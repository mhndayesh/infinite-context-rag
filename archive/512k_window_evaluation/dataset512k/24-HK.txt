A labour dispute case involving overtime pay recently concluded by the Wuhan Intermediate People 's Court should be closely studied by employers . <h> Case overview <p> In May 2021 , Zhang joined a group acquisition company in Wuhan and the parties executed a two-year employment contract that specified a monthly wage of RMB16,000 USD2,252 and an eight-hour workday . After joining the company , Zhang often used WeChat to deal with work matters after working hours , sometimes just replying to simple work questions but at other times holding online work meetings , sometimes for just a few minutes but at other times lasting several hours . <p> In November 2021 , Zhang terminated his employment relationship with the company and instituted arbitration proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in overtime pay . <h> Analysis of the decision <p> The two most salient difficulties in determining the overtime involved in using WeChat and other such social media software to handle work after working hours are : <p> The circumstances under which the use of WeChat and other such social media software constitute overtime work ; and <p> How to determine the amount of overtime done and the overtime pay . <p> Concerning the first issue , the court held that , with respect to the issue of invisible overtime work after working hours , it is not limited solely to the employer 's place of work , and the following points should also be comprehensively taken into account : <p> whether the worker handles work matters outside of working hours ; <p> whether the worker expends substantive labour ; and <p> whether such labour eats into the worker 's off hours . <p> With respect to the issue of using social media software , such as WeChat , to carry out work after working hours , if the communications are simple , episodic and of short duration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be deemed overtime work .

The party receiving the infringement warning can institute a legal action requesting the court to confirm that its acts do not constitute trademark infringement . <p> For example , in Paula 's Choice v Kai Men Hong Commercial ( 2021 ) , the rights holder on one hand filed an objection against the preemptively registered trademark " PAULA 'S CHOICE ( ? ? ? ? ) " , seeking its invalidation . On the other hand , in respect of a complaint with the platform lodged by the pirate , which caused the rights holder 's distributor to take down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringement had taken place and claim damages . <p> The court supported the plaintiff 's claims , confirmed that its use of trademarks including " PAULA 'S CHOICE " did not constitute trademark infringement , and upheld its claim for damages . <p> Claims for unfair competition . The trademark rights holder can institute an unfair competition action against malicious rights defence by the pirate . Typically , in respect of malicious complaints to the platform by the pirate , the plaintiff , in Bayer v Li Qing and Zhejiang Taobao Network ( 2017 ) , instituted an action to confirm non-infringement , and also claimed damages for unfair competition , which the court upheld . <p> File countersuit or claim against the malicious action . In response to a malicious action based on trademark right abuse , the defendant may directly file a countersuit or claim damages against the malicious action . <p> In Yanzhi Holdings v Nanfang Black Sesame Group et al ( 2018 ) , the defendant , Nanfang Black Sesame , argued that trademark infringement was not constituted and filed a countersuit by the deadline for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that Nanfang Black Sesame 's use of the term registered by Yanzhi Holdings did not constitute the use of a trademark , and the goods were not similar , so it did not constitute trademark infringement .

In general , merely filing a trademark application with malicious intent or raising objections and invalidations does not constitute infringement or unfair competition . <p> However , in some cases , courts have deemed such actions to constitute unfair competition . <p> In the above-mentioned case of Brita v Kangdian ( 2017 ) , the court held that the defendant 's acts of malicious registration and abuse of objection procedures were part of its large-scale and wide-ranging infringement , and constituted unfair competition . <p> In Emerson v Xiamen Anjier et al ( 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the defendant was against the principle of good faith , harmed the plaintiff 's lawful rights and interests , and constituted unfair competition .

Specific elements and evidence requirements for different countermeasures vary among cases . <p> Generally speaking , when dealing with rights abuses , an enterprise needs to integrate an administrative confirmation of rights with a civil infringement procedure to claim damage and safeguard its lawful rights and interests -- filing for invalidation of the preemptively registered trademark while instituting a countersuit against the malicious defence , or filing a separate action to confirm non-infringement , an unfair competition action or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enterprises <p> From the perspective of prevention , given that confirmation of rights and subsequent administrative and civil proceedings involved in abuses of trademark rights are time-consuming , enterprises are advised to file their trademark applications -- especially core trademarks -- as early as possible based on their business plans , with subsequent monitoring and inspection to promptly raise objections to invalidate preemptively registered trademarks , preventing adverse impact on normal business operations due to malicious registrations . <p> If an enterprise has encountered preemptive registration of its trademark , or even malicious litigation , it should collect and prepare ample evidence , and actively respond to the action , combining both administrative and civil procedures to effectively combat the preemptive registration and rights abuse , to ensure protection of the business 's legitimate interests . <p> Hu Miao is an associate at Wan Rui Law Firm .

Editors will consider whether it adds to the understanding of a story , and will resist including something simply to appeal to morbid interest . HKFP will usually pixelate or exclude instances of dismembered limbs , mutilated bodies , executions , or the moment of death .

We may also describe an individual 's appearance if part of the story -- however , we will avoid using stereotypes such as " sexy " or defamatory terms such as " ugly . " <p> A person whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth is known as transgender -- HKFP will respect a person 's preferred pronouns if they indicate such a desire . We make reference to sexual " orientation , " not " preference .

If we are unable to do so , we will highlight that the rumour is unverified . We will take steps to protect the identities of market sources who confirm rumours as they may be liable to regulatory or legal action whilst reporters are not , though we will approach their information with the appropriate scepticism . <p> Paid-for Content <p> HKFP often works with carefully selected and relevant advertisers who wish to reach our audience or support our mission .

Marijuana advocates are gearing up for Saturday , April 20 , 2024 . Known as 4/20 , marijuana 's high holiday is marked by large crowds gathering in parks , at festivals and on college campuses to smoke together . This year , activists can reflect on how far the movement has come . ( AP Photo/Richard Vogel , File ) ASSOCIATED PRESS/Richard Vogel <p> Saturday marks marijuana culture 's high holiday , 4/20 , when college students gather -- at 4:20 p.m. -- in clouds of smoke on campus quads and pot shops in legal-weed states thank their customers with discounts . <p> This year 's edition provides an occasion for activists to reflect on how far their movement has come , with recreational pot now allowed in nearly half the states and the nation 's capital . Many states have instituted " social equity " measures to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , reap financial benefits from legalization . And the White House has shown an openness to marijuana reform . <p> The origins of the date , and the term " 420 " generally , were long murky . Some claimed it referred to a police code for marijuana possession or that it derived from Bob Dylan 's " Rainy Day Women No. 12 &amp; 35 , " with its refrain of " Everybody must get stoned " -- 420 being the product of 12 times 35 . <p> But the prevailing explanation is that it started in the 1970s with a group of bell-bottomed buddies from San Rafael High School , in California 's Marin County north of San Francisco , who called themselves " the Waldos . " A friend 's brother was afraid of getting busted for a patch of cannabis he was growing in the woods at nearby Point Reyes , so he drew a map and gave the teens permission to harvest the crop , the story goes . <p> During fall 1971 , at 4:20 p.m. , just after classes and football practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemist Louis Pasteur , smoke a joint and head out to search for the weed patch . They never did find it , but their private lexicon -- " 420 Louie " and later just " 420 " -- would take on a life of its own . <p> The Waldos saved postmarked letters and other artifacts from the 1970s referencing " 420 , " which they now keep in a bank vault , and when the Oxford English Dictionary added the term in 2017 , it cited some of those documents as the earliest recorded uses . <p> HOW DID ' 420 ' SPREAD ? <p> A brother of one of the Waldos was a close friend of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh , as Lesh once confirmed in an interview with the Huffington Post , now HuffPost . The Waldos began hanging out in the band 's circle and the slang spread . <p> Fast-forward to the early 1990s : Steve Bloom , a reporter for the cannabis magazine High Times , was at a Dead show when he was handed a flier urging people to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Bolinas Ridge sunset spot on Mt . Tamalpais . " High Times published it . <p> " It 's a phenomenon , " one of the Waldos , Steve Capper , now 69 , once told The Associated Press . " Most things die within a couple years , but this just goes on and on . It 's not like someday somebody 's going to say , ' OK , Cannabis New Year 's is on June 23rd now . ' " <p> While the Waldos came up with the term , the people who made the flier distributed at the Dead show -- and effectively turned 4/20 into a holiday -- remain unknown . <p> HOW IS IT CELEBRATED ? <p> With weed , naturally . <p> Some celebrations are bigger than others : The Mile High 420 Festival in Denver , for example , typically draws thousands and describes itself as the largest free 4/20 event in the world . Hippie Hill in San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park has also attracted massive crowds , but the gathering was canceled this year , with organizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> College quads and statehouse lawns are also known for drawing 4/20 celebrations , with the University of Colorado Boulder historically among the largest , though not so much since administrators banned the annual smokeout over a decade ago . <p> Some breweries make beers that are 420-themed , but not laced , including SweetWater Brewing in Atlanta , which is throwing a 420 music festival this weekend and whose founders went to the University of Colorado . <p> Lagunitas Brewing in Petaluma , California , releases its " Waldos ' Special Ale " every year on 4/20 in partnership with the term 's coiners . That 's where the Waldos will be this Saturday to sample the beer , for which they picked out " hops that smell and taste like the dankest marijuana , " one Waldo , Dave Reddix , said via email . <p> 4/20 has also become a big industry event , with vendors gathering to try each other 's wares . <p> THE POLITICS <p> The number of states allowing recreational marijuana has grown to 24 after recent legalization campaigns succeeded in Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for medical purposes , including Kentucky , where medical marijuana legislation that passed last year will take effect in 2025 . Additional states permit only products with low THC , marijuana 's main psychoactive ingredient , for certain medical conditions . <p> But marijuana is still illegal under federal law . It is listed with drugs such as heroin under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act , meaning it has no federally accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse . <p> The Biden administration , however , has taken some steps toward marijuana reform . The president has pardoned thousands of people who were convicted of " simple possession " on federal land and in the District of Columbia . <p> The Department of Health and Human Services last year recommended to the Drug Enforcement Administration that marijuana be reclassified as Schedule III , which would affirm its medical use under federal law . <p> According to a Gallup poll last fall , 70% of adults support legalization , the highest level yet recorded by the polling firm and more than double the roughly 30% who backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Seattle 's Hempfest more than three decades ago , reflected on the extent to which the marijuana industry has evolved during his lifetime . <p> " It 's surreal to drive by stores that are selling cannabis , " he said . " A lot of people laughed at us , saying , ' This will never happen . ' " <p> WHAT DOES IT MEAN ? <p> McPeak described 4/20 these days as a " mixed bag . " Despite the legalization movement 's progress , many smaller growers are struggling to compete against large producers , he said , and many Americans are still behind bars for weed convictions . <p> " We can celebrate the victories that we 've had , and we can also strategize and organize to further the cause , " he said . " Despite the kind of complacency that some people might feel , we still got work to do . We 've got to keep earning that shoe leather until we get everybody out of jails and prisons .

@@107575236 <p> Airborne viruses will be called " pathogens that transmit through the air " under new terminology the World Health Organization hopes will end a scientific rift that hampered the early response to Covid-19 . <p> After two years of consultations involving over 100 scientists , a WHO-led working group agreed to the term to describe diseases caused by infectious particles that typically multiply in the respiratory tract and spread from the nose and throat of an infected person while they breathe , speak , sing , cough or sneeze . <p> While the discussion may seem trivial , it carries important economic and public health consequences . How pathogens transmit determines what control measures are most effective at preventing their spread . As Covid erupted in early 2020 , the WHO maintained for months that the fast-spreading virus was n't airborne -- delaying recommendations for mask-wearing and indoor ventilation , and frustrating aerosol scientists who believe the misguided advice cost lives . <p> " Science changes , " Jeremy Farrar , who took over as chief scientist at the Geneva-based agency about a year ago , said in an interview . " All you can do honorably is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time . " <p> Evidence gathered in the ensuing four years has prompted worldwide government action to mitigate airborne diseases . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month detailed steps that people can take to reduce the number of respiratory particles circulating indoors , a year after the White House set a " clean air in buildings " challenge . The WHO itself released in March an 83-page manual that can be used to assess the risk of airborne Covid spread . <p> Some researchers have also proposed mandating indoor air quality standards for public buildings . Still , tackling airborne infections remains controversial . The lengthy consultation process around the WHO 's new terminology was " extremely complex and sensitive , " according to the working group 's report , released Thursday . <p> Global Implications <p> The report reaches consensus on the term " infectious respiratory particles , " moves away from a strict dichotomy of particle sizes , and accepts that smaller infectious respiratory particles can be transmitted at both short and longer ranges . <p> Their potential consequences , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors . Infections capable of spreading long distances through the air on tiny respiratory particles may call for rigorous and expensive infection control measures , such as the wearing of particulate-filtering respirator masks and specialized hospital rooms in health-care settings . <p> " This would have legal , logistic , operational and financial consequences that have global implications with regards to equity and access , " the report added . <p> The terminology sets common language that engineers , physicists , clinicians , and epidemiologists will be able to apply in determining the broad implications of airborne particles , along with the effectiveness of countermeasures like face masks and respirators , Farrar said . <p> " In the first hours , days , and weeks of a new respiratory pandemic , it 's issues like , ' do masks work ? ' And , if masks do work , ' what type of mask , ' which will have enormous impact on the ability to protect communities and health-care workers , " he said . <p> Old Teachings <p> In March 2020 , the WHO issued guidance for health workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through direct contact and respiratory " droplets " measuring 5-10 micrometers in diameter .

With personal protective equipment in short supply , people were advised not to not wear masks unless they were sick or taking care of someone who was . <p> The new terminology acknowledges that infectious respiratory particles exist on a continuum spectrum of sizes , and recommends against applying definitive cut off points to distinguish smaller from larger particles . <p> " That 's a positive step , " said physicist Lidia Morawska , a distinguished professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at Australia 's Queensland University of Technology , who worked on the WHO report . <p> In early 2020 , Morawska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airborne spread and called on the United Nations agency to change its guidance on Covid transmission . <p> The WHO should have acknowledged airborne spread " much earlier , based on the available evidence , " the body 's former chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told Science before leaving the post in late 2022.

@@108499237 <h> Q : Does part-time employment qualify for statutory annual leave ? <p> A : Current laws and regulations do not specify this clearly . The prevailing view in judicial practice is that statutory annual leave is intended for full-time employees , excluding part-time employees . Certain regions like Jiangsu and Zhejiang explicitly state that part-time employees are not entitled to statutory annual leave . However , if a company explicitly agrees or stipulates in its regulations that part-time employees are entitled to statutory annual leave , there are no legal restrictions against this . <h> Q : How many times the daily wage should a company pay for unused annual leave ? <p> A : Twice the daily wage . According to article 10 of the Implementation Measures for the Paid Annual Leave for Enterprise , the compensation for unused annual leave , calculated at 300% of the wage , already includes the regular wages paid during the normal working period . This means that one-third of this compensation is covered by the regular wages already paid . Therefore , when compensating for unused annual leave , companies are required to pay only an additional double the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common view adopted in judicial decisions nationwide . <h> Q : What is the basis for calculating compensation for unused annual leave ? <p> A : As per article 11 of the above-mentioned measures , the daily wage for calculating compensation is derived by dividing the employee 's monthly wage by the average number of working days in the month ( 21.75 days ) . The monthly wage refers to the average monthly wage paid by the employer in the 12 months preceding the payment for unused annual leave , excluding overtime pay . If the employee has worked less than 12 months , the average is calculated based on the months worked . In cases of employment termination , the calculation generally uses the average monthly wage from the 12 months preceding the termination , excluding overtime pay . <h> Q : What is the maximum period for which employees can claim compensation for unused annual leave ? <p> A : The payment of twice the wages for unused annual leave serves as economic compensation for workers ' inability to enjoy their rights to rest and this payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this are subject to a one-year ordinary statute of limitations for arbitration . Employees can claim compensation for the current year starting from 1 January of the following year . If the employment relationship is terminated , the statute of limitations begins from the date of termination . However , if the employer permits the employee to carry over annual leave to subsequent years , the statute of limitations begins on 1 January of the year following the last permitted year . Therefore , an employee can typically claim compensation for up to two years of untaken statutory annual leave wages ( i.e. , for the current year and previous year ) . If the employer explicitly stipulates that annual leave can be arranged across years but ultimately fails to do so , the employee can at most claim up to three years ( i.e. , the current year , previous year , and the year prior to that ) of untaken statutory annual leave wages . <h> Q : Can companies deduct periods when the employment relationship was suspended from the calculation of annual leave days ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a suspension of the employment relationship , an employee does not provide any labour to the employer . Consequently , the employer may deduct the period of suspension when calculating the employee 's annual leave entitlement . For instance , in Ding v Yicheng Network Technology ( 2022 ) , the employee was entitled to five days of statutory annual leave for the year 2021 . However , since the employment relationship was suspended starting April 2021 , the court determined that the calculation of the statutory annual leave for that year should only include the period up to March 31 , resulting in an entitlement of just one day of annual leave . <h> Q : Is compensation required for unused welfare annual leave ? <p> A : Welfare annual leave is an additional vacation provided by companies on top of the statutory annual leave . The prevailing judicial opinion holds that employees are not entitled to claim compensation for unused welfare annual leave unless the company has agreed to such compensation in a contract or policy .

According to article 10 of the implementation measures , a company can only nullify unused statutory annual leave without compensation if two conditions are met : ( 1 ) the employer has proactively arranged for the employee to take leave , and ( 2 ) the employee is unable to take the leave due to personal reasons and has formally waived their right to paid annual leave in writing . If these conditions are not met , the prevailing judicial opinion tends to disfavour supporting companies in withholding compensation for untaken statutory annual leave based on such voiding policies . <p> A : Typically not . The prevailing judicial opinion maintains that wages for unused annual leave do not constitute labour remuneration .

As a result , fund managers and third parties have employed various internal and external credibility enhancement measures , including providing capital preservation and guaranteed returns commitments . However , disputes often arise when fund managers or third parties fail to fulfil these commitments . This article aims to provide a brief analysis of this issue . <h> Legal validity <p> Guaranteed redemption commitments made by fund managers are invalid . Articles 2 and 19 of the Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Asset Management Business of Financial Institutions explicitly prohibit fund managers from making capital preservation and guaranteed returns commitments .

It also states that regardless of the form , whether it 's through drawer agreements or other means of stipulating capital preservation or guaranteed return clauses , they should be deemed invalid . Therefore , regardless of the nature of the redemption commitment made by the fund manager , it will be considered invalid . <p> Guaranteed redemption commitments made by investment advisers are invalid .

Regarding redemption commitments made by related parties of the fund manager , external credibility enhancement measures are typically implemented through commitments such as guaranteed principal and returns commitments , shortfall makeup agreements , redemption clauses , repurchase obligations , fixed income , joint guarantees , and similar commitments . There is no clear provision in relevant laws and regulations , leading to different views in judicial practice . Some precedents consider the fund manager 's shareholders and other related parties as independent entities , and agreements signed with investors in their names represent their true intentions , without violating mandatory legal provisions , and should be deemed valid . However , other precedents believe that although the related parties are not fund managers themselves , they are associated with the fund manager 's interests , and investors are aware that the party making the capital preservation and guaranteed returns commitment is related to the fund manager . The intention of all parties to the agreement is to obtain capital preservation and guaranteed returns from the fund investment . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalid . <p> For third parties other than the fund manager and its related parties who make capital preservation and guaranteed returns commitments , judicial practice distinguishes and determines whether a guarantee contract relationship , joint assumption of debt , a unilateral promise or another legal relationship was established based on specific facts . Precedents often consider commitments to be valid when they represent the true intentions of the parties involved , do not violate mandatory legal and regulatory provisions , and will likely find that a creditor-debtor relationship between the parties reflected in the corresponding commitment is a borrowing and lending relationship , allowing the claimed annualised returns and penalties for breach of contract to be subject to the upper limit of private lending interest rates according to the commitment . <p> Agreements stipulating the return of principal after the determination of losses are generally considered valid.Judicial practice often determines that compensating investors for their losses after the fund term expires or after losses have occurred does not fall under the scope of expected capital preservation and guaranteed return commitments but represents the true intentions of the parties involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties should fulfil their contractual obligations according to the agreement . <p> Different views exist on whether the invalidity of guaranteed redemption clauses leads to the overall invalidity of the fund contract . In general , the judiciary can determine that clauses that solely guarantee capital preservation and guaranteed returns are invalid based on article 92 of the court minutes , which states that " contracts containing clauses guaranteeing fixed returns on capital , principal , or redemption as agreed between trustees such as trust companies , commercial banks , and other financial institutions and beneficiaries should be deemed invalid " . However , some argue that since guaranteed redemption clauses are important factors for investors when making investment decisions , invalidating these clauses would render the purpose of the fund contract unachievable , and therefore the entire fund contract should be deemed invalid . <p> In conclusion , although judicial practices may vary slightly depending on the circumstances , the overall focus remains on protecting investor rights and maintaining the order of financial market transactions through lawful judgments . Private fund managers should prioritise compliance with financial regulatory provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to avoid penalties or being held responsible for the invalidity of capital preservation and guaranteed return clauses . As for investors , it is important to make rational investments with a clear understanding of the high risks associated with financial products and not easily trust various promises of capital preservation and guaranteed returns , and to maintain relevant written documentation to safeguard their legal rights . <p> Yang Jiamei is a partner at Kangda Law Firm .

@@109790233 <h> Navigating China 's New Employment Trends and Implications <p> Amid structural employment challenges , the Chinese government is ramping up policy support and new employment trends are emerging . Businesses should stay agile , invest in talent , and adapt to changing market dynamics to accommodate the implications . <p> China 's average urban unemployment rate declined to 5.2 percent in the first quarter , marking a 0.3 percentage point decrease from the previous year , according to the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) . Official data reveals that 3.03 million new urban jobs were created during this period . The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security ( MOHRSS ) reports a stable employment situation , with job market demand rising after the Spring Festival as businesses resume operations . Notably , recruitment has increased weekly , especially in service-related sectors , such as transportation , logistics , catering , and tourism . <p> Despite this , China faces structural employment challenges . The slowing economy , along with the collapse of the property market , has led to a hiring slowdown , especially affecting new graduates . Although some industries and small and medium-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban employment has reached a record high , continuing to pressure the job market , with different groups facing unique challenges . <p> In this article , we navigate the new trends observed in China 's employment landscape and analyze the implications for businesses . <h> China 's structural employment challenges <h> China 's youth unemployment rate declines but challenges persist <p> After a six-month hiatus , China 's NBS has again released official youth unemployment rate data for December 2023 . The rate stands at 14.9 percent , down from over 21 percent in June 2023 . Notably , the methodology for measurement has been revised to exclude students . However , even with this adjustment , the lower result remains nearly three times the national average of 5.1 percent and exceeds the OECD average of 10.5 percent . <p> Cultural pressures also play a significant role . Many young Chinese workers face a grueling " 9-9-6 " work schedule -- working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. , six days a week -- leading to burnout . As a result , some individuals choose to " lie flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional children , " relying on their parents or grandparents for financial support . <h> Job insecurity for Chinese workers in their 30s and 40s <p> China 's economic challenges extend beyond recent university graduates ; workers in their 30s and 40s are also grappling with increased job instability . For instance , a 35-year-old employee may face higher odds of rejection due to age-related biases . According to an April 2023 survey conducted by human resources company Zhaopin , 85 percent of workers perceive barriers to securing or retaining employment beyond age 35 , especially in industries such as internet technology , finance , and automobiles . <p> The underlying reasons are straightforward . Companies , struggling amid a weak economic recovery , are trimming labor costs by reducing hiring and letting go of older employees in favor of younger , more cost-effective staff . Additionally , local government subsidies incentivize hiring university graduates , further disadvantaging older workers . These seasoned professionals often contend with higher household expenses , including childcare , making them particularly vulnerable . <h> Challenges faced by rural workers and gig workers <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gig workers . Many lack stable employment opportunities and face precarious working conditions . They often struggle with low wages , lack of social security benefits , and limited access to training and skills development . Additionally , the seasonal and unpredictable nature of gig work further compounds these challenges , making financial stability difficult to achieve . <h> Gender challenges in China 's job market <p> China faces unique gender-related challenges in its job market . The interplay of higher death rates and fewer births creates additional constraints for younger Chinese women . Unfortunately , societal norms and employers often discourage women from joining the workforce , favoring traditional roles of staying home to raise children . This pressure exacerbates gender inequality , limiting opportunities for young women to pursue fulfilling careers . <h> Policy support for employment <p> The challenging job market in China necessitates strong government policy support . In 2024 , the country anticipates 11.79 million university graduates , up by 210,000 from the previous year . To address this influx , China aims to create over 12 million new urban jobs while maintaining an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous year , 12.44 million urban jobs were added , with an average urban unemployment rate of 5.2 percent , according to official data . <p> To address these challenges , the government has promoted efforts to support youth employment and provide better job guidance and entrepreneurial opportunities . Recently , the MHRSS reported organizing approximately 64,000 recruitment events nationwide during a three-month spring campaign , offering over 43 million jobs -- an impressive 10 percent increase from the previous year in both event numbers and job opportunities . <p> On a broader level , support for small and medium-sized enterprises remains crucial to achieving the 2024 employment target . Structural improvements are necessary to guide graduates toward vocational and technical roles as part of talent development strategies . <p> Moreover , the MOHRSS and eight other departments are intensifying efforts to create job opportunities for rural workers , leveraging local employment service stations and industrial clusters . Enhancing job security and welfare protections for these workers is essential for fostering inclusive economic growth . <h> Emerging employment trends in China <h> A surge in demand for technology professionals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system centered on advanced manufacturing is fueling demand for skilled workers . A recent report from the Social Science Academic Press highlights a nationwide shortage of approximately 25 to 30 million digital talents .

For instance , leading electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is experiencing heightened demand for roles like system architects , software professionals , and AI experts . <p> The latest update to China 's National Occupation Classification Code introduces 97 digital occupations for the first time , including roles such as internet marketing specialists , fintech professionals , and e-sports personnel .

Roles like sorting and delivery workers saw an eight-fold increase in demand , as highlighted in Zhaopin 's report . Technicians , housekeepers , drivers , and security guards also experienced high demand . Average monthly salaries for blue-collar positions in 38 major cities monitored by Zhaopin averaged RMB 7,215 ( US$1,016 ) , marking a 35.8 percent increase from 2019 -- outpacing overall salary growth by 7.6 percentage points . <h> Expanding service sector jobs <p> Meanwhile , the services industry continues to expand rapidly , offering more flexible employment opportunities .

This clarification is a significant benefit for relevant enterprises . <p> Compared to the 2003 policy , another major highlight of the MOF and STA Announcement No.14 is the removal of the requirement for restructuring to be approved by county-level or higher government authorities and enterprise supervisory departments . This change broadens the applicability of stamp tax incentives to include private enterprises , reflecting policy fairness and unity , and stimulating the vitality of various business entities .

Starting from January 1 , 2025 , the industry income rates for all industries will be reduced . <p> The Foshan Individual Income Tax Industry Income Rate Table includes seven categories of industries .

These guidelines aim to provide detailed tax guidance for cross-border e-commerce enterprises with overseas warehouses , helping them to accurately understand export tax refund ( exemption ) policies and proficiently manage the related processes , thereby better adapting to new industry trends . <p> Export tax refunds refer to the reimbursement of indirect taxes ( including VAT and consumption tax ) paid during the domestic production and circulation stages of exported goods and services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods eligible for tax refunds ( exemptions ) are those that have been declared to customs , have physically left the country , and have been sold to foreign entities or individuals .

Based on the sales model , overseas warehouse exports can be categorized into two scenarios : <p> Direct sales to foreign companies : Cross-border e-commerce enterprises sell goods to foreign companies at the time of export , and the goods are stored in designated overseas warehouses upon arrival . These goods are subsequently sold by foreign companies on e-commerce platforms .

To support the development of new business models in cross-border e-commerce , the tax authorities have optimized the tax refund management system , allowing enterprises to choose between a one-time tax refund application or batch applications based on actual sales , without waiting for the complete sale of a batch of goods . <p> According to the guidelines , the procedures and requirements for export tax refunds ( exemptions ) for cross-border e-commerce overseas warehouses are as follows : <p> Items <p> Details <p> Export tax refund ( exemption ) filing <p> Enterprises must first file for export tax refunds ( exemptions ) through platforms such as the electronic tax bureau or the international trade " single window .

@@115729237 <h> Consumers ' rights to repair support sustainability aims <p> In July 2022 , the Press Information Bureau ( PIB ) issued a press release announcing the establishment of a committee to develop a comprehensive framework on the right to repair ( committee ) . This committee , established by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs ( MCA ) , was given a remit to create a framework as a part of the LiFE ( Lifestyle for Environment ) initiative . This would permit end-use consumers and buyers in India to access equipment and spare parts , allowing them to repair the products they had already purchased . This would then put services provided by original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) and those of third-party sellers and retailers on an equal basis . <p> As part of this initiative , the Right to Repair India portal was set up by the Department of Consumer Affairs under the MCA , with the objective of ensuring greater sustainability of products by facilitating their repair and reuse . The framework reflected the need to protect consumers ' rights to receive cost-effective repairs in the cardinal sectors identified by the committee . The sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portal , are farming equipment ; mobile phones and tablets ; consumer durables , and automobiles and automobile equipment . <p> Under the proposed framework , it will be mandatory for OEMs to share with consumers the details of the products that they sell so that consumers have a higher level of control over the functionality and longevity of their products . Currently , each OEM may voluntarily sign-up to the portal and upload details regarding the quality of their products and the product components , and warranty and post-sale information . <p> In that decision , the CCI held that the practice of restricting and denying independent repairers of automobiles access to spare vehicle parts by way of end-user licensing agreements was anti-competitive . The reason the practice was adopted by the OEMs of automobiles and automobile components and spare parts was to ensure that only the OEMs or licensed vendors could repair automobiles . <p> While the CCI did not seek to establish an overarching recognition of the right to repair , it deemed any restriction under which a dominant enterprise sought to establish dominance in an adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) and 4(2) ( e ) of the Competition Act , 2002 . The decision affirmed that the restriction imposed by OEMs not only impacted independent repairers but also detrimentally hampered consumer welfare because the consumer 's right to receive cost-effective repairs was constrained . <p> Addressing some of the concerns highlighted in the CCI determination , the PIB issued a press release on 6 July 2024 , noting the importance of repair manuals and videos being readily available . It set out the primary hurdle that consumers faced , namely the increased restriction of their right to repair because of significant delays in repair services and the non-availability of genuine spare parts at affordable prices . <p> The Department of Consumer Affairs has urged automobile companies to sign-up to the portal . This further step by the government has resulted in an increased ability of end-consumers to exercise their rights to repair , in particular relating to the vehicles they already own . Industry giants such as TVS , Tata Motors and Honda have signed up to the portal , allowing consumers to view details such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of the service centres available throughout the country , together with product repair manuals and repair videos . <p> In an interesting initiative in the sector , Tata Motors and TVS have created repair videos that address the most common concerns faced by consumers . These videos are now accessible on their YouTube channels . <p> The growing awareness of key stakeholders in the sector is making it easier to achieve the goal of a circular economy in which consumers can easily access the information they need to repair their vehicles and keep them on the road , a sustainability objective . <p> Ashima Obhan is a senior partner and Natasha Matange is an associate at Obhan &amp; Associates . 
@@115729238 <p> Disputes arose between SBI General Insurance ( insurer ) and Krish Spinning in regard to claims made by Krish Spinning under an insurance policy . Krish Spinning accepted a discharge voucher by which the insurer agreed to pay a fraction of the loss towards a full and final settlement of claims . Later , but well within the period of limitation for invoking arbitration , Krish Spinning claimed that it had accepted the voucher under economic duress and coercion and invoked arbitration for the remainder of its claims . The court had to determine whether the acceptance of the discharge voucher operated as a bar against invoking arbitration and what was the scope of a judicial inquiry in proceedings to appoint arbitrators under the act . <p> It is settled law that a full and final settlement , or discharge of a contract through accord and satisfaction , do not , of themselves , render an arbitration clause inoperable . The arbitration clause is a separate and distinct contract , which survives the discharged contract . Whether there is a final settlement or the contract stands discharged are mixed questions of fact and law , which must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause may be invoked . <p> The court held that the judgment in Vidya Drolia v Durga Trading Corporation had reiterated the principle of minimal judicial intervention in arbitration matters while permitting interference by the referral court to ensure claims that are without merit on their face are not arbitrated . However , the subsequent decisions in Indian Oil Corporation v NCC Limited and NTPC Ltd v SPML Infra Ltd had wrongly interpreted the decision in Vidya Drolia to mean that the referral court can decide on the accord and satisfaction of claims . These decisions had laid down the eye of the needle test enabling the referral court to reject arbitration in exceptional cases where the plea of fraud or coercion in arriving at a full and final settlement appeared to be devoid of merit on its face . <p> However , the court followed the seven-judge bench decision in In Re : Interplay , which reiterated that the role of the referral court was limited to examining the existence of an arbitration agreement that appeared to be valid and nothing else . It held that a referral court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle nor look at the apparent merits of a claim . <p> The judgment in Krish Spinning is based on three principles . First is negative competence-competence , which requires that when a matter falls within the exclusive domain of the arbitrator the court in the first instance should not look into the matter even for a determination on the face of the matter . The next is the second look principle , the possibility of a subsequent judicial review in recognition and enforcement proceedings . Last is the lack of a statutory appeal against orders made by the referral court . <p> The court also held that when deciding the issue of limitation in the exercise of its power to appoint arbitrators , a court must restrict its scope to whether the application was filed within three years , the period of limitation . The question of whether the claims themselves were time-barred must be left to the arbitrator . <p> The decision is welcome because it again limits court interference and leaves matters for the tribunal to decide . While the act was amended in 2019 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international principles of arbitral autonomy , such changes have not yet been brought into force . Krish Spinning is one of several recent judicial pronouncements trying to align jurisprudence with the unrealised legislative intent . <p> This ruling underscores the importance of precise drafting of arbitration clauses and settlement agreements . The applicability and survival of the arbitration clause in the event of a discharge and settlement must be express and clear . When settlements are concluded , parties must expressly record that such agreements were made as the result of informed choices , without duress , economic or otherwise , to avoid one of them taking a second bite at the cherry . 
@@115729239 <h> Enforcing anti-dilution rights brings unforeseen consequences <p> The most popular way investors protect the value of their investments is by including anti-dilution rights in their investment agreements . Such rights prevent an investor 's shareholding from being diluted in a down round , that is when a company raises capital at a price lower than that paid by the investor . In such cases , investors have the right to require their original investments be repriced to ensure that they maintain their stake without having to make further contributions . <p> In India , anti-dilution rights are usually of two types , full ratchet or a broad-based weighted average . The full ratchet formula reprices the investor 's shares to match the price offered in the down round . The broad-based weighted average revises the price per share by calculating various factors such as the number and price of shares issued during the down round and the price at which the original investors invested . The resultant change in the company 's shareholding using a broad-based weighted average formula is more acceptable to founders and other shareholders than the full ratchet formula , which results in the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement of antidilution rights faces legal and practical hurdles . The simplest way to give effect to antidilution rights is to incorporate the antidilution formula into the terms of the convertible securities such that the conversion price is automatically adjusted to ensure the investor acquires more equity on conversion . However , this may not be appropriate for foreign investors because , under the Foreign Exchange Management ( Non-Debt Instruments ) Rules , 2019 ( NDI rules ) , the conversion formula for all convertible instruments issued by an Indian company to a foreign investor must be determined upfront . Further , the NDI rules prohibit a foreign investor from subscribing to shares at a price lower than the fair market value . This prevents non-resident investors from adjusting their conversion price below the fair market value determined at the time of subscription to the securities . <p> Where investments are made at a premium , companies may adjust the conversion price up to the fair market value at the time of issue . Until recently , companies were discouraged from raising such investments at a premium because the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tax from AY 2025-26 will allow companies and investors flexibility in pricing investments . <p> Where the conversion price can not be adjusted , companies may honour their commitments by issuing shares via a bonus issue or , at the lowest legally permissible price , through a rights issue . However , Indian law requires that rights and bonus shares be offered to all shareholders of the company uniformly . Where anti-dilution rights are triggered for only some investors , giving effect to anti-dilution rights through rights or bonus issues may be difficult . <p> The NDI rules allow rights shares to be issued at a price lower than fair market value provided the same price is offered to both non-residents and residents . It is arguable that the benefit will be unavailable where only some investors participate in a rights issue leading to a disproportionate increase in shareholding , especially when such investors are non-residents . <p> The law requires a company to issue bonus shares from its free reserves , securities premium account or capital redemption reserve account , which may not be possible for loss-making companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonus issue is not made proportionately to all shareholders , those benefitting from such an issue may face adverse tax consequences for having received shares at a price less than their fair market value . <p> Investors may try to purchase the shares of the founders at the lowest permissible price or the parties may agree that the founders will receive a lower return in any liquidation event . However , these options also attract adverse tax consequences and may be restricted under the NDI rules when the founders are residents and the investors are non-residents . <p> Parties must exercise caution when implementing structures for antidilution protection . When stakeholders look to enforce their rights disproportionately , building consensus and understanding the implications for the company and the various investors are key to assessing the risks involved .

Failure to adhere to the foreign employee work permit regulations may result in penalties of up to KHR12.6 million ( USD3,136 ) imposed by the MLVT , and/or up to KHR18 million by a court . <p> According to the firm , by Guideline 517 on Administrative Fines for Enterprises Employing Foreign Employees without Work Permit issued on 17 January 2023 , the MLVT can impose administrative fines based on the actual number of foreign employees without valid work permits if fewer than five are found . For enterprises with five or more foreign employees working without work permits , a maximum administrative fine of KHR63 million , five times the MLVT 's fine , may be imposed . <p> Repeated offences could lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment ranging from six days to one month for individuals hiring or retaining foreign employees without work permits . <h> CHINA <h> China 's Company Law amendments <p> On 29 December 2023 , the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress of China promulgated the amended Company Law , after its deliberation of four versions of draft amendments in the past three years . The new Company Law will come into force on 1 July 2024 . <p> The new Company Law not only governs new companies established after its effective date , but also has significant implications on existing companies . Yet , the implementation of many articles is still subject to further interpretation and/or guidance from the Chinese authorities and courts . <p> Therefore , foreign companies , investors and other stakeholders should pay close attention to this new legislation and the pertinent regulations , judicial interpretations and other official guidelines that may be issued concerning its implementation in the near future . <p> It is advisable for foreign companies and their investors to revisit the companies ' governance structure and assess : ( 1 ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company law requirements ( e.g. number of supervisors or alternatives , applicability of mandatory employee representation , board meeting quorum and resolution ) ; and ( 2 ) If the governance structure can be improved ( and if a streamlined governance structure would be preferable ) in view of the greater flexibility introduced by the new Company Law and based on the specific needs of firms . <p> Considering the increasing exposure to personal liabilities of directors , supervisors and senior management , companies may consider including indemnification clauses in the articles of association , and/or purchasing ( director ) liability insurance to give more protection to directors acting in good faith and with due care . That said , whether local company registration authorities will accept filing of amended articles of association with such special clauses ( including indemnification clauses ) is to be tested in practice . <h> Turnover standards raised for M&amp;A anti-monopoly filing <p> The State Council published in full its revised Provisions on Thresholds for the Filing of Concentrations of Undertakings on 26 January 2024 , and the standards came into force on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions that meet the following filing standards will trigger the anti-monopoly filing obligation in China : <p> ( 1 ) The combined worldwide turnover of all undertakings participating in the concentration exceeds RMB12 billion ( USD1.7 billion -- RMB10 billion before the revision ) , or the combined turnover in China exceeds RMB4 billion ( RMB2 billion before the revision ) ; and <p> ( 2 ) At least two undertakings have turnover in China of more than RMB800 million ( RMB400 million before the revision ) . <p> In addition to raising the turnover standard significantly , a draft of the provisions for comment , published by the State Administration for Market Regulation in June 2022 , also proposed a new hybrid filing standard that could take into account both turnover and market value ( or valuation ) of the parties , so as to strengthen the supervision over startup acquisitions characterised by a relatively high transaction amount but low turnover of the target company . <p> However , the provisions ultimately do not incorporate this hybrid filing standard , and continue to determine whether a transaction should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertakings involved . <p> One of the most significant penalties for the non-disclosure of a cyberattack involved the credit reporting agency Equifax .

The majority of the apex court , in an obiter statement , tentatively introduced the " primacy principle " as a prospective norm in Singapore arbitration law . <p> The principle states that when the enforcement court is not barred by transnational issue estoppel from scrutinising issues related to the validity of an arbitral award , it might be deemed appropriate to accord precedence to the seat court 's prior decision . This presumption can be rebutted only by specific considerations , such as public policy concerns relevant to the jurisdiction of the enforcement court . <h> Singapore GST increase warrants monitoring <p> Singapore has increased its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on most supplies of goods and services as well as on imported goods -- by 1% from 1 January 2024 .

@@117605230 <h> Great expectations for Philippines ' Register for Well-known Marks ' <p> As of now , the only way for a trademark to be conferred ' well-known ' status in the Philippines has been through an adversarial procedure . But this changes with the upcoming roll-out of the Register for Well-Known Marks by the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines ( IPOPHL ) . It is expected that the new regulations will provide clearer guidance and enhance the protection of well-known marks . However , the introduction of such a recordation system is a significant shift and raises some apprehension . <h> Draft rules <p> The IPOPHL held a public consultation on 24 September 2024 , introducing the proposed new rules and regulations envisaged for the declaration and creation of the registry for well-known marks . The draft rules provide for a stricter standard in determining well-known status . Rule 5 requires " a majority of the 12 criteria " with three requisite criteria , namely : <p> Market share in the Philippines and in other countries of the goods and/or services ; <p> Degree of the inherent or acquired distinction of the mark ; and <p> Presence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used on identical or similar goods or services , and owned by persons other than the person claiming their mark is a well-known mark . <p> The majority requirement means that the applicant or claimant must demonstrate that the mark satisfies at least seven of the specified criteria for inclusion in the register . This deviates from the 2017 rules , which only required the satisfaction of " any combination " of the criteria , meaning as few as two may suffice . There is also greater emphasis placed on the qualitative strength of the evidence , rather than the plurality of criteria . Under the 2017 rules , there is no requirement or preference for certain criteria . Despite this lower threshold , however , achieving well-known status was already very challenging for many famous brands . <p> The draft rules provide that the declaration of well-known mark would be valid for 10 years , renewable every 10 years , provided the registrant is able to prove continuous use by submitting the necessary evidence within one year from the fifth anniversary of the declaration and upon each renewal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draft regulations propose motu proprio ( without formal notification ) revocation of the mark 's well-known status.This means ongoing administrative responsibilities for trademark holders of well-known marks . <p> Nonetheless , in case of revocation of status due to non-submission of the required evidence , the trademark holder may still resort to sections 123(e) or 123(f) protection in an adversarial proceeding , albeit having to prove that the mark still meets the majority of the criteria . <h> Securing trademarks <p> Despite concerns regarding the proposed recordation system , many agree that there are several advantages to maintaining such registry . By formally registering a mark as well known , the trademark owner gains stronger legal presumptions of ownership and exclusivity . Rule 15 states that a declaration of a well-known mark constitutes prima facieevidence of its well-known status . This makes it easier to prevent others from using similar marks that could cause confusion among relevant consumers . <p> A registry for well-known marks will therefore serve as a powerful deterrent against infringement and unfair competition . It will allow international brands to more effectively utilise well-known status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from unlawful activities . <p> Further , well-known status can help brand owners demonstrate that another rival trademark applicant or registrant is in bad faith -- or had prior knowledge of the existence of the well-known mark -- because its inclusion in the registry would serve as constructive notice . <h> Key takeaways <p> Having a well-known mark on a formal registry increases the brand 's overall value and credibility in the eyes of consumers , business partners and investors.Well-known marks enjoy consumer trust due to their established reputation , and being formally recognised as such through a registry would further strengthen the mark 's market position . <p> This will also facilitate the creation of more opportunities for licensing , franchising and strategic partnerships . Overall , such a registry helps preserve the commercial interests of the brand owner . <p> The proposed rules for the establishment of a Register for Well-Known Marks are in line with the broader policy of streamlining procedures in trademark registration and strengthening the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the country . <p> These rules would ensure that well-known marks receive an expansive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and article 16 of the TRIPS Agreement , to which the Philippines is a signatory .

However , despite it being a steep learning curve , everyone climbs it , with time . " <p> For Zarapkar , a complex and volatile business environment brings about " a whole host of BD opportunities for law firms " . However , " it also comes with a set of internal expectations and pressures on BD teams as required to meet stiff internal deadlines . This can create stressful situations for BD professionals , who are required to balance internal and external relationships with stakeholders . " <p> Anand builds on this theme . " Law firms often set ambitious targets , leading BD professionals to work long hours to meet these demands , " she says . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-stakes nature of legal work creates additional stress . " <p> She has observed a visible disconnect between lawyers and their BD teams . " Lawyers are sometimes reluctant to embrace BD initiatives due to various reasons such as paucity of time and priorities , leading to potential friction between them and the BD teams , " she says . <p> Conversely , Sihag says pressure can be stimulating if it is controlled . " I think a little pressure now and then keeps things interesting , " she says . <p> " The most common issue I 've heard from my BD peers is the feeling of being less visible or valued compared to lawyers -- it often comes down to the mindset of the leadership , which in turn trickles down across the firm .

That makes a big difference in how we work together . " Das has an optimistic approach . " Discarding the random marketing/practice **25;1204;TOOLONG initiatives , firms are now increasingly blending technology to implement a data-driven and an integrated approach to deepen client relationships , " he says . <p> " Hence , in my view I see an upside with the growing importance and acceptability of such professionals owing to standardisations of service experience and related processes , and increasing interactions with multi-jurisdictional law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at AZB , which is leanly staffed , makes sure we meet the demands of the hour . " <p> AZB 's Shroff says that , for BDs , " being proactive while supporting the lawyers remains the need of the hour " . <p> Abbas urges firms to hire professionals with appropriate skillsets . " They should invest in their BD team with the correct lawyer and BD team ratio , train them well and , as a result , they would be able to support the firm in a much better way , " he says . <p> Anand says it is essential for law firms to recognise and invest in their BD teams and to ensure " they can navigate the complexities of client acquisition , market expansion and reputation management effectively " . <p> Sihag rates forward thinking and quality ahead of quantity .

Typically , white-collar employees in managerial and supervisory roles fall outside the purview of the ID act and their employment is governed by the applicable state-specific Shops and Establishments Act ( shops act ) along with the terms in their employment agreements . <p> Section 25FF of the ID act offers specific protection to employees under the workmen category in the event the ownership or management of a business is transferred , which in effect , results in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with at least one year of continuous service are entitled to compensation as if they were retrenched under section 25F of the ID act .

Exceptions similar to the ID act in respect of uninterrupted service , favourable terms and continuity of benefits are also provided under the shops acts . <p> If employees in the workman category are terminated due to redundancy post reorganisation or as a consequence of their refusal to consent to the transfer , employers are required to comply with section 25F of the ID act . This section also requires the employer to comply with other obligations under the ID act , such as the last in , first out principle and issuing a notice to the labour authorities . <p> When looking into the compliances under state-specific shops acts for non-workmen employees , employers should bear in mind that certain state-specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , it may be prudent to explore alternative separation strategies such as drawing up robust settlement agreements with such employees .

It must be ensured that the benefits accrued are paid out or contributions are made by the transferor entity at the end of the employment of the affected employees . In case of continued service , the benefits should be extended at par or on better terms than those provided during employment with the transferor entity .

With natural improvement and a better barrier ( 4 ) this time , he looks the one to beat , especially with Zac Purton staying aboard . #6 Charming Legend was highly impressive on debut , scoring convincingly for Danny Shum Chap-shing . While Zac Purton seemingly opts for Johannes Brahms , James McDonald is a quality replacement . He faces a tougher task from barrier 10. #13 Markwin comes into this on the back of a commanding maiden win in Class 4 and looks capable of stepping up in grade for the Cody Mo yard . #9 Leslie has turned in strong late finishes in recent runs and now gets the benefit of barrier 2 .

That effort came on his first try at 1400m and in Class 2 , and he should be primed to make amends with Joao Moreira taking the reins . #9 Young Champion raced too keenly over the mile last time , which may have left him without a finishing effort . The drop back in trip suits him , giving him a strong chance to rebound . #4 Drombeg Banner looks set for a reasonably soft lead on paper and will ensure his rivals have to chase him down , as is his typical style . #12 Rubylot did n't fire on his initial attempt in this grade last start , but he has been kept sharp with a nice trial and deserves another chance to prove himself .
