" <p> " As a result , growth of 5.82 percent has been achieved in the current financial year despite a contractionary policy . We will be able to achieve 6.75 percent growth in the next fiscal year . " <p> He hoped these measures would start to bear fruit before 2025 . <p> " We expect it inflation to begin to decline by the end of this year . Let 's see . We must try . And , as you have noticed , we have reduced the scope of the budget a lot so that there is no pressure on prices .

Later it was revised up to 7.5 percent . But even that goal could not be met . <p> According to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics , the 11-month average inflation rate in the current fiscal year until May stood at 9.73 percent , the highest in many years . This naturally means intense pressure on lower and middle-class families to afford daily necessities . <p> Economists are sceptical that the current finance minister will be able to stick to his confident target of 6.5 percent average inflation when it has remained above 9 percent for two years . <p> But Mahmood Ali remains optimistic . <p> " We have taken all the necessary steps to control inflation and are reviewing what further steps can be taken . " <p> " The measures taken by us have made it possible to keep inflation at 9 percent . In the budget speech presented yesterday Thursday , I mentioned the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Highlighting the context of inflation due to the Russia-Ukraine war after the COVID-19 pandemic , the finance minister said , " Inflation is still at 9 percent in our country . If the developed countries of the world increase interest rates in their countries to control inflation , the capital flow in our country will continue to decrease . At the same time , the volume of international trade also increased to a great extent . " <p> " This resulted in a large deficit in our current account balance . All in all , the pressure on the foreign exchange reserves increased and this led to a significant depreciation of the taka against foreign currencies . This is one of the main reasons why we have high inflation . " <p> " We have seen our neighbouring country Sri Lanka go bankrupt , and some have said Bangladesh is heading the same way . But we have n't . We 're working on a continuous and dynamic model , which should be noted .

There has been no indication that the market has destabilised following the budget announcement , " he said . <p> Highlighting the government efforts to ease the inflationary pressure on people , Titu said , " We are providing subsidised food assistance to 10 million people through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh and are considering proposals to expand this support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish permanent locations for TCB dealers and to ensure some products are sold at their original prices alongside subsidised items . " <p> " Importantly , there have been no announcements about increasing commodity prices . On the contrary , we have announced reductions , " <p> The government will rely on bank loans to cover the large budget deficit , preferring local banks over low-interest foreign loans . <p> To fund this spending , he plans to raise Tk 5.41 trillion from the government revenue , which will be a big challenge to implement . <p> Despite this , the overall deficit between the government 's spending and revenue will be Tk 2.51 trillion , which is still 8 percent higher than the revised budget for the fiscal year 2023-24 . <p> The deficit , at 4.6 percent of gross domestic product or GDP , is the lowest in the past decade . <p> Ali plans to borrow Tk 1.27 trillion from abroad and nearly Tk 1.61 trillion domestically .

Consequently , we are increasingly turning to domestic sources , " he explained . <p> Khairuzzaman also discussed the government 's shift in borrowing strategy : " Historically , our focus was on savings certificates , which , while secure , come with higher interest costs . This is why we 're steering away from them and toward utilising the banking system more . " <p> The secretary revealed that the government 's borrowing from banks in the current fiscal year exceeded its target by 18 percent .

" <p> NBR BOSS DEFENDS OPPORTUNITY TO LEGALISE BLACK MONEY <p> The proposed budget includes a clause reintroducing the whitening of investments , such as black money , undisclosed assets , land , flats , and shares , by paying a 15 percent tax . <p> Criticising the decision , the Centre for Policy Dialogue or CPD said that offering a 15 percent tax rate to legalise black money is neither morally , nor economically justifiable , especially when the maximum tax rate for individuals is set at 30 percent . <p> The think tank argued that this penalises regular taxpayers . <p> Minister Ali asked NBR Chairman Muneem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press conference . <p> Despite defending the legalisation of black money , the NBR chairman could not say if anyone had done it before or how much money was involved . <p> Muneem explained , " When such amnesty is given , it 's often perceived as a way to convert black money into white . However , this particular amnesty is aimed at addressing undisclosed assets that exist for various reasons . " <p> He emphasised that many countries provide similar opportunities to declare assets that were previously unreported for unavoidable circumstances . <p> This measure , he claimed , was in response to demands from the business community and the common people , aiming to facilitate compliance and prevent money laundering . <p> Muneem said that black money typically does not benefit the national economy and is often spent abroad . <p> The government hopes to bring this money into the mainstream economy , encouraging individuals to declare their undisclosed assets and comply with tax regulations . <p> When asked if former inspector general of police Benazir Ahmed 's black money could be legalised by paying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case is currently under legal review . <p> The matter of Benazir Ahmed 's assets has now fallen under criminal ( legal ) proceedings .

Instead , our bodies may go into a mild " hibernation mode , " where metabolism slows as activity decreases , making weight loss a bit more challenging . <h> Tips to Avoid Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed lifestyle during the colder months , following some strategies can prevent gaining extra pounds . <h> Stay Active Indoors <p> When outdoor exercise feels less appealing , find ways to keep moving indoors . There are countless ways to stay active at home , from following online workout videos to using home fitness equipment . You can try online classes in yoga , dance , or high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) . <p> Create a home gym setup with resistance bands , dumbbells , or kettlebells . You can also incorporate bodyweight exercises like squats , lunges , and push-ups that require minimal space . Staying active at home burns calories and keeps your mood and energy up during those winter days . <h> Set Winter Fitness Goals <p> Sometimes , all it takes is a goal to keep you focused . Setting specific , achievable goals like improving strength , running a certain distance , or completing a workout challenge can provide motivation . Winter is a perfect time to work on endurance , flexibility , or strength , as these can be developed indoors with minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Winter foods do not have to be heavy to be comforting . Root vegetables like sweet potatoes , carrots , and parsnips , along with leafy greens like cabbage and spinach , are winter staples that are both nutritious and satisfying . Try making lighter versions of classic comfort foods , like soups and stews with plenty of veggies , lean proteins , and low-sodium broths . <h> Practice Mindful Eating <p> Mindful eating is all about slowing down and truly savouring each bite , which can help reduce overeating . In winter , many people tend to eat more out of boredom or to seek comfort . Therefore , it is necessary to pay attention to hunger cues and avoid eating in front of screens . Try to focus on each meal , chew thoroughly , and consider portion sizes . <h> Choose Snacks Wisely <p> Smart snacking can prevent winter weight gain by curbing cravings and stabilizing energy . Choose high-protein , high-fibre options like yoghurt with apple slices with peanut butter . These snacks keep you full and help avoid unhealthy choices later . Stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy spikes and crashes . <h> Control Your Stress <p> Managing stress , especially during the winter season , can help prevent weight gain . High stress increases cortisol , a hormone that can lead to weight gain and cravings for junk food . To keep stress levels low , try techniques like exercise , meditation , yoga , or deep breathing . These methods help control cortisol and reduce the likelihood of overeating unhealthy foods . <h> Boost Your Vitamin D Levels <p> Lower sunlight exposure in winter can lead to a drop in vitamin D , which plays a role in maintaining a healthy immune system and mood . You can boost vitamin D by spending a few minutes outside when the sun is out , even on colder days . Try including vitamin D-rich foods like fish , egg yolks , and fortified dairy . Consider discussing supplements with a healthcare provider . <h> Stay Hydrated <p> It is common to drink less water in winter because the cold weather may make you less thirsty . However , hydration is just as essential in winter as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overeating , as thirst is sometimes mistaken for hunger . You should carry a water bottle around , and drink herbal teas for warmth and hydration without added calories . <h> Prioritize Sleep <p> Adequate sleep is essential for weight management because it regulates hormones that control hunger and appetite . Short winter days may disrupt sleep cycles , but try to maintain a regular sleep schedule . Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to keep energy levels balanced and reduce cravings for sugary or high-carb foods . <h> Make Exercise a Social Activity <p> Staying active can be more fun with friends or family . Look for local winter sports or try virtual workout challenges with friends . Many gyms also offer winter workout programs or challenges that can help you stay consistent . Making fitness a social commitment adds accountability , increasing the likelihood of sticking to your routine . <h> Plan Your Meals Ahead <p> Meal planning can help you avoid impulsive food choices that are high in calories .

Fiber also supports fullness and prevents overeating . Include fiber-rich foods like vegetables , fruits , whole grains , and nuts to help maintain balance and control calorie intake during festive meals . <h> Do not Skip Workouts <p> It can be tempting to skip workouts when it is dark and cold outside , but consistency is key . Even short workouts , such as a 20-minute HIIT session , can be effective .

PHOTO : REUTERS <p> The first target under Sustainable Development Goal ( SDG ) #10 reads , " By 2030 , progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population at a rate higher than the national average . " This calls upon all nations to bolster the income of the bottom 40 percent of the population by promoting economic , social and political inclusion of all people , irrespective of their sex , age , physical conditions such as disability , religion , race , class , ethnicity , etc . The achievement of this global target requires creating appropriate and equal opportunities , empowerment of women , and reduction of poverty and inequality . The ongoing work of the interim government 's public administration and constitutional reform commissions needs a focus on these aspects so that the future elected government may work to fulfil SDG 10 , as Bangladesh has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this global goal . <p> There are data challenges with regard to having a proper understanding of the income inequality situation in Bangladesh . According to UNDP data , the income share of the bottom 40 percent of the country 's population is 11 percent . In sharp contrast , for the top 10 percent , the income share is 43 percent . Based on Household Income and Expenditure Survey ( HIES ) , 2022 , the income of the bottom 40 percent population grows at 7.7 percent per annum , while the annual growth rate of income of the total population is 9.1 percent . The HIES 2022 shows that the top 10 percent of households increased their share of wealth to 40.91 percent , around 2.83 percent rise since 2016 . The bottom 50 percent of the households had 19.05 percent of the total income in 2022 , which came down from 20.23 percent in 2016 . <p> Even though the country achieved progress in poverty reduction , the income Gini coefficient has been on the rise .

Whether we consider the well-known measure , the Gini coefficient , or an alternative measure like the Palma ratio , and compare the income share of the top 10 percent with the income share of the bottom 40 percent , we get the same result , which demonstrates that inequality is consistently rising in our society . <p> The constitutional commitment of ensuring social and economic equality among the citizens of the country can sustain without resulting in major social and political unrest . However , there is no reason to assume that income and wealth inequality will come down automatically . The common strategic options that are available to reduce inequality are participatory planning and inclusive development , pro-poor budget formulation and implementation , skills development , progressive taxation of income , adoption of appropriate legislation , scrapping of discriminatory laws , realistic minimum wage fixation , improved governance , effective measures against corruption , containment of inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium enterprises , and greater investment in the social sector . <p> In Bangladesh , the major challenges hindering the achievement of economic and social equality are : low public expenditure on education , training , health , rural development and social protection ; poor direct tax collection and a culture of tax evasion ; high level of selection error in social protection schemes ; and high percentage ( 12.6 percent ) of female-headed households with limited assets and means of production .

This area , in fact , has been plagued by waterlogging since the early 1980s , primarily due to the construction of embankments and sluice gates that disrupted the natural flow and dried up nearby rivers . In recent years , waterlogging has not only deteriorated in Bhabadaha but also spread to neighbouring areas . Currently , at least 300 villages in Jashore 's Abhaynagar , Manirampur , and Keshabpur , Khulna 's Dumuria and Phultala , and Satkhira 's Sadar and Tala upazilas are grappling with severe waterlogging , affecting around 10 lakh people . <p> Reportedly , over 200 schools in these areas have been inundated , depriving thousands of children of education , while around 50,000 farmers in 10 upazilas of the three districts are facing uncertainty over growing the Boro crop this season , as about 96,000 hectares of farmland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interventions . <p> Unfortunately , the authorities have allowed this problem to persist for decades despite a proven solution being available : the Tidal River Management ( TRM ) .

Local influential figures , benefitting from shrimp farming in the waterlogged areas , have also obstructed efforts to address the issue , leaving farmers and ordinary residents to bear the brunt . Although the previous Awami League government implemented several projects spending crores of taka , these were not scientifically sound and failed to provide lasting solutions . <p> Pumping out water from the affected areas and dredging nearby rivers can offer only temporary relief , so locals need a permanent solution . That 's why implementing TRM is crucial .

Therefore , immediate action is needed from the government . For a long-term solution , the government should begin implementing TRM in the region .

This is advantageous as Chinese manufacturers in Bangladesh would be able to sell goods cheaply in China . <p> The tariffs on Chinese goods might be further hiked to up to 60 percent , making those uncompetitive in the US markets . <p> Prior to the US election on November 5 , Donald Trump declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tariff on Chinese goods by up to 60 percent . <p> In his previous tenure , Trump increased the tariff on Chinese goods to 25 percent from nearly 3 percent with effect from January 2018 . <p> Because of the higher tariff on Chinese goods , the shipment of garment items from other countries like Vietnam , Cambodia , and Bangladesh to the US started rising and the global share of China in garment trade also declined to a great extent . <p> For instance , the Chinese share in global garment trade is now at 31 percent while it was more than 36 percent five years ago . <p> On the other hand , Bangladesh 's share in the global garment trade increased from 5 percent to nearly 8 percent over the last five years .

@@117998237 <h> COP29 negotiations : The deadlock over cardinal issues <p> Activists hold a silent protest inside the COP29 venue to demand that rich nations provide climate finance to developing countries , during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Baku on November 16 , 2024 . PHOTO : AFP <p> On November 21 , several important issues including climate finance , mitigation ambition , Article 6 of the Paris Agreement about emissions trading , and loss and damage fund were discussed at the Conference of Parties 29 ( COP29 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) . However , this COP was supposed to be the COP of climate finance , as the Paris Agreement stipulated that by 2025 a new collective quantified goal ( NCQG ) had to be agreed upon , keeping the earlier target of $100 billion as the floor . In the last COP in Dubai , it was reiterated that a decision text has to be agreed upon about the NCQG at COP29 . Climate finance is a cross-cutting issue . It is the enabler of all climate actions and has several dedicated agenda items , with NCQG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared by the Azeri Presidency on NCQG on November 21 . It was perhaps pushed by the UN Secretary General 's request to leaders of the G20 meeting in Brazil so that they instruct their ministers attending the second high-level segment in Baku to reach an agreement on climate finance . The initial draft began with more than 150 paragraphs with many bracketed options and sub-options . The latest draft , as of writing this article , has 61 paragraphs , again with many bracketed options . The number one issue is the quantum -- the NCQG . The developing countries are demanding an amount of $1 trillion to 1.3 trillion a year over a 10-year period , up to 2035 , with mid-term reviews either in 2030 or 2031 . This number is based on a minimum need for implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions ( NDCs ) and National Adaptation Plans ( NAPs ) . <p> However , the implementation of climate actions in developing countries is estimated to require $6-8 trillion a year . Some analysts view this number as a kind of sleight of hand accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be mobilised from all sources -- public , private and alternative sources . At the press conference , jointly organised by the G77 group and the African Negotiating Group on November 20 , in response to whether they will accept $200 billion a year , the Bolivian delegate cynically referred to the amount as a joke . The Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) and Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) are demanding $220 billion and $39 billion respectively a year in grant- and grant-equivalent terms . Further , they demand at least 20 percent of climate finance must flow through the Convention funds like the Green Climate Fund . So far , only about 2-3 percent of global climate finance flowed through these funds . These funds have better terms and access is relatively easier . <p> The global financial system is awash with liquidity . For example , in 2021-2022 , fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $1.1 trillion and the annual military spending stood at more than $2.2 trillion in 2023 . So , money does not flow where it is needed the most -- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change . We may recall that just before the beginning of COP29 , four authoritative reports were published by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , UNFCCC and World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) about the gaps in emission reduction , gaps in adaptation finance and poor ambitions in the current set of NDCs . These reports served as wake-up calls for urgent actions to bridge these gaps . <p> There is also the issue of the quality of climate finance which includes the definition of climate finance , grants versus loans , access to finance , co-financing , etc , and is even more important than the NCQG number . The Bangladesh delegation loudly voiced concerns about quality-related issues , specifically the need for a definition of climate finance , as its absence allows developed countries to inflate their contributions through double and triple counting . Also , the grant versus loan issue is extremely important because more than half of the LDCs are already debt-distressed and climate loans further restrain their fiscal space . Most of the LDCs spend much more on paying interest against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their countries . So , they strongly called for debt cancellation and debt relief for low-income countries . There is also a demand for the inclusion of contingency clauses in bilateral and multilateral loan agreements . Spain and Denmark in particular are supportive of the contingency clauses against disasters so that the impacted countries can get debt relief and debt rescheduling for longer terms . Related to this is the issue of reforms of multilateral financial institutions , which now provide about 45 percent of climate finance . However , the World Bank , in particular , which now hosts the Loss and Damage Fund , is not familiar with dealing with human rights and climate justice . The latest draft text included all these issues , but developing countries ' demands remain bracketed . <p> The draft also included sources of mobilisation -- bilateral , multilateral , alternative , innovative and philanthropic . It mentions innovative sources like debt for nature swaps , local currency financing , etc , but they are not detailed . Past experience of debt for nature swaps is not encouraging , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intermediaries , which did not strengthen the debt sustainability of the recipient countries . I have published a paper on debt-for-adaptation-swap at bilateral levels , where deals can be reached quicker than at multilateral levels , which are very cumbersome and time-consuming . <p> The second most important issue of this COP -- full operationalisation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement -- about emissions trading still hangs in the balance due to differences in ensuring transparency about detailed information to be posted in the UNFCCC portal called agreed electronic format . My article on this issue was published in The Daily Star at the beginning of this month . <p> The negotiations extended beyond November 22 , as in the past few COPs . The strategy , particularly of the developed world , is to wean out all the energy and appetite of small delegations from most of the global south . Also , there is a " wait and see " policy of how developments unfold at the last hours when some numbers and compromises are agreed upon to wrap up . Being a negotiator with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations a process of " active inaction . " For the right reasons , Bangladesh 's Chief Adviser Prof Yunus has called for downscaling these jamborees , which have an average presence of more than 70,000 delegates both from governments and observer organisations .

@@117998238 <h> Developed nations are missing the bus <p> They must fulfil their obligations in combating climate change <p> Sat Nov 23 , 2024 07:00 PM Last update on : Sat Nov 23 , 2024 07:42 PM <p> We are disheartened by the outcome of the negotiations at the COP29 summit between developed and developing countries regarding the amount of money the former will pay the latter to tackle the devastating impacts of climate change . As we all know , developed countries are the biggest contributors to climate change , while developing nations bear the highest costs of its impacts . This is why developing nations have expressed their shock at the $250 billion per year fund proposed in a draft deal by the developed nations . It is a deliberate deviation from their commitment to the Paris Agreement . <p> Developing countries had called for $1.3 trillion to be mobilised annually by developed countries . The funds would be in the form of grants and would be disbursed starting next year . Another draft -- the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance ( NCQG ) -- has also proven disappointing , as our adviser to the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package for failing to meet the essential needs of the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) and the Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) . <p> It seems the developed nations have chosen to disregard the spirit of the Paris Agreement , which clearly states that developed countries are to provide financial resources to assist developing nations in their mitigation and adaptation efforts . It is also disconcerting that not all of these funds will be grants ; some will come in the form of loans , which experts warn could increase the indebtedness of poorer nations already burdened by loans for their development needs . The latest text at COP29 has broadened the base of climate finance donors , meaning some developing countries may also have to contribute to the targeted $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 . <p> These developments do not bode well for our future . The effects of climate change are becoming more severe and frequent each year , as manifested all over the world , but more profoundly in poorer nations . It makes little sense that developed nations have chosen to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments . Contributing to climate funding is not a favour to developed nations -- it is an obligation . <p> Experts have reiterated that we are still heading in the wrong direction , with greenhouse gas emissions increasing rather than decreasing . The goal of limiting the temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees Celsius is becoming more and more far-fetched . This places millions of people at risk of being displaced , suffering severe health problems , and experiencing adverse societal changes globally . Developed countries must realise that they are jeopardising the survival of humankind as a whole by not fulfilling their obligations to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change . It is in their own interest , as much as it is in that of the developing world .

Reportedly , the Bangladesh Water Development Board ( BWDB ) dredged a nine-kilometre stretch of the canal in 2021 under a project intended to restore its natural flow . However , upon completion in 2022 , heaps of excavated earth and garbage were left piled along its banks . These were eventually washed back into the canal by rain , reducing it to a narrow ditch . It 's baffling why the BWDB would leave excavated earth on the banks instead of disposing of it responsibly . Was n't it part of the project to clear it as well ? Such oversight from a state agency is simply unacceptable . <p> A few decades ago , this 12-kilometre-long and 20-45 foot-wide canal was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation , boats used it for transporting goods , and it acted as a natural drainage channel for rainwater into the Karnaphuli River . However , siltation and indiscriminate dumping of garbage gradually blocked its flow , causing severe waterlogging along its banks . The BWDB initiated the project to address this problem , but the canal became clogged again due to its mismanagement . <p> Unfortunately , this counterproductive practice of leaving excavated material after dredging canals and rivers on their banks is all too common across the country . In Dhaka , for instance , city corporations often leave canal and drain waste on the banks or roads . This defeats the very purpose of cleaning or excavation drives , resulting in further public suffering . Moreover , such unplanned work squanders public funds . In the case of Leinga canal , for instance , around Tk 2 crore was effectively wasted . This is unacceptable . <p> Over the decades , unplanned development projects have cost the nation thousands of crores , but to little avail . The situation was particularly bad during the 15-plus years Awami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public interest projects . This must stop . We urge the interim government to ensure transparency and accountability in all such initiatives so that public money is no longer squandered due to the inefficiency or corruption of project authorities .

@@117998240 <h> Of frequent demands and conspiracies <p> Students of Government Titumir College take to the streets in Mohakhali , Dhaka on November 18 , 2024 demanding for an upgrade to university status . Their demonstration caused traffic gridlock across the capital and disrupted rail communication with the rest of the country . FILE PHOTO : PRABIR DAS <p> A spectre is haunting Bangladesh . Any group staging protests to press home their demands is quickly labelled as " ghosts " of the previous regime . Demands are seen as conspiracies to unsettle the government , and exorcising the spirit has become a priority for those running the show . <p> This is a narrative that we have seen promoted by successive regimes . Old habits die hard . The apparitions of political sectarianism are reappearing . The pedal rickshaw pullers , the students demanding universities , the injured July protesters seeking government attention -- anyone with demands is being othered , and often dehumanised . Viewing the opponents as morally repugnant is part of a culture of political divisiveness that creates a feedback loop of hatred . <p> Perhaps 100-plus days since the regime change are not enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " other " to come clean -- be it legal or social -- it will be difficult to establish political and economic stability . Our overseas partners need assurances that their investments are secure . Our entrepreneurs need the guarantee to run their businesses without hindrances . It can only happen when all citizens begin to feel safe and included . <p> The vandalism of " enemy " property or the exodus of businessmen close to the previous regime has added to our economic woes . The unemployment rate has shot up , and the lines before the subsidised food trucks are getting longer by the day . Depending simply on overseas bailouts and remittances will not mend the wounds inflicted by the stealing of money or a broken financial body . The chief adviser 's declaration to include members of the former party only after due process of trials is a welcome move . It at least gives many the hope of seeing the emergence of a democratic system . <p> Democracy requires participation from all stakeholders . By privileging one body or opinion and silencing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already seen how one clandestine group used the former government as a Trojan horse to foray into their realm . The detrimental process requires reform . Then again , it should be allowed only after following due diligence . Conversely , democracy is not synonymous with mobocracy where anything goes , and petty interests prevail over greater ones . <p> The perception of Awami League 's return in different guises is something that is held by many . There may be some truth in the idea that groups of rickshaw pullers , garment workers , students , and other disgruntled people are being manipulated , though only those with institutional intelligence have insights into such matters . Common sense , however , dictates that the root cause of dissatisfaction needs to be extracted so that the bad tooth does not pain the entire body . <p> Dehumanising the " other " simply gives the government an excuse to ignore the core problems . The injured students who waylaid the health adviser , for instance , were quickly identified as students of Chhatra League who have taken advantage of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a proper list of the injured is a question that we can ask . During the July uprising , we received regular updates of names and numbers . So what 's stopping the authorities from preparing such lists now ? <p> Similarly , the battery-run rickshaw drivers were called associates of various ward commissioners of the past regime . It is surprising that a government comprising many NGO leaders is announcing policies without thinking of the rehabilitation of those affected by said policies . There is a huge battery industry to aid the 40 lakh illegal battery-run rickshaws that are plying the streets around the country . Where will these people go ? What will they do ? Will they be pushed into crime ? <p> If your livelihood is stripped away , do you really need to be a member of conspirators to take to the streets ? What alternative routes or earning options are we proposing for them ? The same goes for the idea of banning polythene .

The government has sought time to review the merit of the proposal , while the suspicion about the anarchy let loose by the students of said colleges is rife among the netizens . <p> This is solidified by the fact that one of the seven colleges affiliated with Dhaka University has broken ranks with its peers . The students of Government Titumir College believe that they have the necessary infrastructure to have their own university . Maybe they see many private universities in the city operating under the roofs of multi-storey buildings . Perhaps they are under the impression that they are adequately equipped to have a university of their own . <p> I think the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) should seriously consider merging universities to reverse the process of " quantity over quality " policy followed by the previous government . The populist attempt to have universities everywhere has spread our resources thin . Even in the US , struggling institutions are merged to bring them under consolidated management . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiring colleges that feel that rebranding would add value to their degrees .

This I can tell from my own experience of conducting exams at these colleges . <p> But when these students keep on blocking major streets or vandalising train , their motive becomes clear . They want to hit the iron when it is hot and soft . But it is time for the iron to be solid , without which there will be more copycat agitations . The actions taken by the military in dealing with the students of Dhaka College and City College were necessary . Students seem to be pursuing everything except education , which can not be the norm . The actions , though regrettable , are the results of leniency shown for too long . The message needs to be loud and clear . Reform needs time . This is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one popular graffiti tells us , will require further patience and sacrifices . <p> Those who gave their lives or got injured in the July-August uprising sought systemic change .
