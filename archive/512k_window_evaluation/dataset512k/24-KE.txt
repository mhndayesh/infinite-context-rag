I wanted to try out other mediums and that 's how I found myself doing painting as it was the next logical step . I was already in college studying something else when I decided to take art seriously , and therefore It did n't make sense to change courses and study art as I realised I could continue with the course I was studying while at the same time teaching myself painting . That way I killed two birds with one stone . <p> Can you describe the journey of self-teaching yourself to paint ? What were the initial challenges you faced ? <p> Teaching myself to paint was easy in that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to study how to paint by reading online articles and watching video tutorials . I would watch the tutorials and try to make a painting based on the techniques learned . The challenges I faced were that I had to buy the painting materials out of my own pocket as I was still a student . I did n't know where people buy professional materials and I ended up buying substandard supplies from hardwares and general shops . <p> How has being self-taught influenced your unique artistic style and the subjects you choose to paint ? <p> I do n't have a style , kind of ironic . Since I studied painting from different ( online ) teachers and sources , I could n't really stick to one person 's method or style . This led me to figuring out how to paint efficiently in a way that worked for me . Most of my paintings are mostly portraits and I sought out to study painting portraits as that 's what I was interested in . I have never really sought out landscape painting and other subjects . Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How do you choose your subjects and themes for your paintings , and what personal significance do they hold for you ? <p> Most of my paintings are based on my surroundings , environment and my own experiences . When I see something or an idea that would really translate well in a painting , I always give it a try . This is mostly human interactions and activities where I yearn to capture the moment and mood in my painting . The more recent series of students that I am working on is based on my experiences in school . After graduating I found myself examining how long I had spent in school and I realised I had spent most of my life in school a total of 16 years . This led me to ask myself a lot of questions about how school influenced me positively and also negatively . This led to that student series where I try to look at those moments and try to capture them . <p> At what point in your painting journey did you realise that you were on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , I got an opportunity to visit Germany for a month to showcase my artwork . I had never really thought that art would open such doors for me . I was just doing art because I was passionate about it and could not imagine myself doing something else . <p> Well , being self-taught has led me to look at things in the non-classical and traditional way of painting . This can be seen in how I started painting people from an aerial perspective just because I wanted to and I was n't stuck in painting people from the normal eye level view that 's used mainly in school and formal art institutions . Being self-taught also lets me combine different art influences in my paintings such as illustration and caricatures . <p> In 2014 you won the award of Most Promising Male Artist . How has this shaped your career since then ? <p> The award from the Museum did n't really have a big impact on my career .

However , I only take criticism seriously only if it 's from a person that I would also take advice from . I usually listen and give myself time to think about whether the criticism makes sense or not without letting my ego get in the way . That way I have been able to improve my artwork in ways that I could n't have if I was only relying on my own judgement only . <p> Having participated in art residencies in Tanzania and Germany , how did it influence you ? <p> The residencies made me strengthen my resolve to continue in art as a career . I also made some great friends who I really admire and how they work and think differently from me . <p> Art often serves as a means of cultural expression .

These issues may be things like the relevance of the education system and group mentality . <p> How do you balance the preservation of traditional Kenyan art forms with the innovation and experimentation in your own work ? <p> I honestly have no idea what Kenyan traditional art forms are . However , I try to experiment with all mediums and techniques available to me . I do n't want to limit myself as I feel different mediums have their own strengths and advantages . That 's why I do painting , sculpture and Digital art . <p> What message or legacy do you hope to leave through your art ? <p> I hope to inspire the younger generation so that they take up art as a career and that they do n't have to limit themselves to one medium only . I also try to focus on issues around me which do n't ' sell ' but are important to me as a Kenyan and African .

This new status pushes others to believe that they too will make it someday . <p> Such instances , rare and far-apart , are attributed more to sheer luck than any strategic intervention . <p> Still the reality is never far away .

Welcome to the vibrant world of homeschooling . <p> This educational approach has gained momentum in recent years , captivating the hearts and minds of parents seeking personalised learning experiences for their children . But what drives this trend ? Is it the allure of tailored education , the flexibility to explore diverse interests , or perhaps the desire for a closer family bond ? <p> One of the most significant benefits of homeschooling is the flexibility it offers .

As 15-year-old Alex says , " I love that I can learn at my own pace and dive deeper into subjects that interest me . The flexibility allows me to pursue my passions , like travel and photography , without falling behind . " <p> Although he acknowledges that he may miss some traditional social experiences , Alex has made great friends through homeschooling co-ops and extracurricular activities , demonstrating that homeschooled children can thrive both academically and socially .

We then quickly parachuted into the era of abductions and disappearances . Then came the Adani deal .

But rage that is not backed with both tactics and strategy would be worse than useless . To chant #RutoMustGo is not enough . By the way Ruto must go and to go he will . But not now .

AFP <p> I was watching the US presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and I could n't help but feel that the more developed a country becomes , the more retrogressive its politics becomes . <p> The debate issues -- and how they were handled especially by Trump -- makes one nostalgic for days gone by when those vying for such seats were people whose personality was impeccable , their standing in society beyond reproach and their character like that of Caesar 's wife - above suspicion . <p> The same is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and they sell their outrageous policies to the electorate who buy it wholesale .

She 's a rabid anti-immigrant endowed with the gift of the garb . She can move masses . So can Trump . And so do most politicians who do nothing else except sell hope which , unfortunately , remains exactly that even after getting into power . <p> Whenever I see Trump speaking , I oscillate between hilarity and contempt . He however knows which button to press to get the right response from the electorate . His people love him , even when he says outrageous things .

" In Springfield , they 're ( immigrants ) eating dogs , the people came in , they 're eating the cats , they 're eating the pets of people that live there .

City officials told news organisations that " there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed , injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community . " <p> Not coincidentally , his running mate JD Vance had earlier trodden the same ground , saying immigrants from Haiti were roasting people 's dogs for dinner . As if that was not enough , Trump also alleged -- again something fact-checkers found to be false -- that " millions " of people were pouring into the country " from prisons and jails , from mental institutions and insane asylums .

The worst fib , according to news organisations , was when she said Trump 's presidency had left America in a worse place employment-wise . <p> What bothers me is those who are anti-immigration forget their own history . America is a country of immigrants . Apart from the native Americans ( pejoratively referred to as Red Indians and depicted in movies as blood-hungry ruffians ) , everyone else is an immigrant . <p> It is also an oft-stated fact that immigrants bring new ideas , are more hungry and therefore more successful . Some of the richest people today in US are immigrants , from Elon Musk ( of Tesla and Space X ) to Jensen Huang of Nvidia ( a chip maker whose current valuation is US$2.65 trillion , third only to Apple and Microsoft ) -- trace their roots to South Africa and Taiwan . <p> Let 's take a minute to appreciate how much US$2.5 trillion actually is .

The read tells of a precious place for Africa in God 's map . The story is at the genesis of the early church . Africa had many delegates in Jerusalem when the Holy Spirit descended . Some of the languages spontaneously spoken were African languages ! This Afro-Pentecost element emboldens Africans to speak to each other and to others about God . God , at this watershed event , speaks Africa 's language thus authenticating Africa 's tongues as couriers of the holy . The universal God wants Africans to understand and experience Him not as a foreigner but as a local " God with us . " <p> The lessons <p> The story of the Ethiopian Eunuch happens at a time when the church was afraid , and disillusioned .

He was stirred to do so by the angel of the Lord . It was God 's initiative that the Ethiopians be reached . Philip did not accidentally stumble onto an African in the desert . He was acting on the instructions of God 's Spirit . This communicates clearly that Africans are not a forgotten lot in God 's heart . God does care for us . That it was God 's initiative that the Ethiopian be reached should stir us also to reach out to God who has already willingly reached out to us . We should stretch our hearts to a God who has already stretched out His hand . <p> . <h> Keep Reading <p> The account could have said " ... a man was going back home from Jerusalem ... " But the account specifies the man and names his nationality and ethnicity as " Ethiopian . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was relevant . The scriptures mention this man very deliberately and describe him very intensively so that it is clear it was not a mere mention - it was intentional . God not only knew his nationality ; He knew his circumstances . God knows who we are . God knows where we are . God 's detailed description of the African is enough to inject confidence in our spirits and make us walk with our heads up as we stride through the corridors of the universe . We may not appear on the map of influential nations , but we are in the heart of the One with the greatest influence in the world -- the Owner of the world . We may not have veto power in the United Nations . But we are known to be the one who holds veto power over all creation . <p> This mission that Philip was dispatched to was a mission of completion . This African man had gone to Jerusalem to worship . He had completed his prayers , his sacrifices and was now returning home . While in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the man had completed what was required , God saw in this completeness a crucial incompleteness . God saw a gap in the whole . God saw a need in wealth . God saw some poverty in the richness . He cares that this African man takes home a complete worship experience . Though some people are happy when we are suffering , God cares that we as Africans experience life in its fullness . While some work hard to manipulate us with a hypocritical appreciation , God desires that we have the full benefit of His Spirit . While some care less when Africa is pulled down and run down , God desires to see us built up and thriving . <p> Just as the Spirit has chosen to befriend us , it is for our own good that we choose this befriending Spirit . Even with centuries of experience , the church today continues in controversy , dividedness and inaccuracy . Is error an inbuilt , inescapable element of the church ? We see the church standing on rickety platforms on critical matters on morality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands mercilessly corrode the integrity of the church , killing its voice and mocking its relevance . <p> While the continent is sagging with a Christianity propelled by a " know it all " attitude , in the Ethiopian story , we see an honest faith . In conceding ignorance , we hear the Ethiopian saying to us that if we do not understand whatever matters , God gives us room to say so . Experience has it that even after we have done our best , there will always be gaps . In His love and to cheer our faithfulness , God takes care of the gaps and the blind corners . Honesty of heart opens the door to an enlightening friendship with God . He does not desire ignorant Christians -- who pride in not knowing . Nor does He desire pretentious disciples -- who claim to know though they know not . <p> Life partner <p> The empty seat in our African chariot is in demand . The world powers from the East and from the West are jostling for it . From the Ethiopian 's inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation that embraces God holistically and welcomes God in its economic , political and social chariots . It is His Spirit 's wisdom that guides us to unlock the beauty of the promised abundant life as we construct and reconstruct the continent .

We must instead choose our companions with the particular patriotic boldness that invests love and laughter in our children .

The court 's answer was unequivocal . <p> It ruled that the practice of employing qualified teachers as interns violates their rights to fair labour practices and equal treatment -- rights that are enshrined in Kenya 's Constitution and supported by various international conventions . <p> I find this ruling both timely and crucial in reinforcing the legal protections available to workers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle : interns , particularly those performing full duties that align with their qualifications , should be regarded as employees .

The court has affirmed that employment is determined by the realities of the working relationship , not merely by the terms of a contract . Any attempt to structure employment agreements in a way that undermines legal and constitutional protections will be subject to rigorous scrutiny under the principles of social justice that underpin our employment laws . <p> This decision is absolutely a watershed moment for Kenyan employment law .

File , Standard <p> In November 1989 , world leaders made a historic commitment to children by adopting the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ( UNCRC ) , an international agreement that promised to protect children 's rights . Since then , the UNCRC has become the most universally accepted human rights treaty in history . <p> Kenya became a signatory to the UNCRC in 1990 . In 2022 , the revision of the 2001 Children Act enshrined the specific legislation safeguarding the rights and welfare of children in Kenya . <p> Kenya 's development depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future-fit workforce . But the burden of poverty that the country continues to face is weighing down the potential of our children 's futures . While Kenya has seen multi-dimensional poverty in children reduce from 59.3 per cent in 2009 to 47.7 per cent in 2019 , an estimated 10.5 million children are still at risk of not achieving their potential in life without urgent action . <p> Thirty-four years after Kenya ratified the UNCRC , some progressive strides have been made in improving child-related indicators across sectors globally . However , inequities between countries and within countries are a significant concern . The challenges facing children everywhere are becoming even more complex , given the pressing impacts of climate change , protracted humanitarian conflicts , demographic movements , technological advancements , rapid urbanisation , displacement , and severely constrained fiscal envelopes , among other issues . <p> The country reports mixed results regarding how Kenya tracks against the SDGs , with some indicators showing progress . In contrast , some have shown stagnation or reversals . For example , overall poverty and maternal and neonatal mortality have shown improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitation , hygiene , and electricity ) , school enrolment and completion rates have also improved . However , poverty in the rural populations , under-nourishment , and general food insecurity has worsened . <p> Kenya has sustained an impressive reduction in stunting ( low height for age due to chronic under-nutrition ) , which dropped from 26 per cent to 18 per cent between 2014 and 2022 . Under-five mortality has also halved from 115 per 1,000 live births in 2003 to 47 per 1,000 live births in 2023 . But the decline in neonatal mortality has been much slower , and the vast majority ( 70 per cent ) of all child deaths are still being caused by preventable diseases such as diarrhoea , pneumonia ( acute respiratory infections ) , malnutrition , anaemia , malaria , measles , HIV , and tuberculosis . <p> Poverty alleviation efforts in the past two years include the government 's expansion of the Cash Transfer Programme ( Inua Jamii ) from 1.2 million households in 2022 to 1.7 million in 2024 . Inua Jamii caters for the most vulnerable members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the elderly to cushion them from poverty . The government 's commitment to expanding Inua Jamii 's coverage to 2.5 million households by 2026 and prioritising poor families with children and those with a high degree of vulnerability is laudable considering that children comprise 42 per cent of the Kenyan population . Sustaining this programme in the coming years is crucial to lifting millions of people from poverty . <p> In addition , a plan to end the Triple Threat ( new HIV infections , gender-based violence , and teenage pregnancy ) against girls and women by 2027 was launched in 2023 . The plan focuses on empowering adolescents and young people while safeguarding them from health vulnerabilities . <p> In Kenya , only 50 per cent of rural schools have basic sanitation facilities . This makes it difficult for girls to manage their menstrual hygiene needs , forcing them to miss school during their periods , or even leading to dropouts . We need renewed commitments to unlock investments towards providing adequate hygiene and sanitation facilities in schools to ensure they are conducive to learning . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutilation ( FGM ) has significantly dropped from 38 per cent in 1998 to 15 per cent in 2022 . However , violence against children remains prevalent as nearly 30 per cent of girls and 38 per cent of boys reported suffering violence in their homes from parents , caregivers , or adult relatives . Increasing the child protection workforce and rolling out the National Parenting Programme will help curb incidences of violence against children . <p> The government has legislated many new progressive laws since signing the UNCRC in 1990 such as the Basic Education Act of 2013 , the 2016 Water Act , and the 2017 Health Act . However , these normative frameworks require adequate funding and allocation of public resources in future . At the national level , social spending increased from 33 per cent to 43.7 per cent between 2014/15 to 2022/23 , while at the county level , social spending improved from 39.7 per cent to 41.7 per cent over the same period .

It presented an opportunity for world leaders to re-commit to SDGs 2030 for children with a focus on ending hunger and malnutrition , building peace , making science and technology more accessible and inclusive , reducing poverty and inequality by removing barriers that limit children 's potential and addressing the negative impacts of climate change . <p> On the occasion of UNCRC 's 35th anniversary , we need to remember that children represent our collective future . Now , more than at any time in history , they need to be at the centre of societal commitments .

PCS <p> No doubt , the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops ( KCCB ) means well . Its excoriation of President William Ruto 's administration is done with good intentions . But an aphorism to the effect that " the road to hell is paved with good intentions " is not altogether inappropriate . Not for the first time , noble minds have started national conversations that have wounded more than healed ; that have widened the fissures of political differences in the country when the intention was to heal rifts that have characterised multi-party politics from inception . <p> It is obvious to all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The ruling party and those who support them and the opposition with attendant subscribers to their tenets . It is therefore almost impossible for many Kenyans to take the middle ground or to see beyond the dichotomy of " us versus them " . It follows therefore that anyone intending to offer constructive criticism to the government must take the high road . Such criticism must be contingent on compelling facts rather than emotional outbursts characteristic of post-truth populism . Sadly , KCCB 's recent criticism of the Kenya Kwanza administration in a media briefing on the state of the nation falls short in some instances . <p> First , the good bishops criticise the government for " unreasonable taxation " through what they call " a constant stream of new taxes . " They fail to appreciate the fact that these tax measures , currently being subjected to public participation , are an extraordinary response to extraordinary times . Navigating a tough economic environment is a global issue , not just a Kenyan one . Countries that have taken the populist route of lowering taxes and interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka followed a fiscal policy of reduced taxation and subsidies on petroleum products and food prices . It defaulted on its sovereign debt resulting in social , economic and political upheaval . Turkey 's Central Bank took on a monetary policy that eased rather than tightened as should have been the case . Inflation reached a decades-high level of 85.5 per cent in October 2022 . Closer home , Malawi , Zambia , Ghana and Ethiopia have defaulted on their sovereign debt . This has led to renegotiations of loans with lenders with grave ramifications to the citizens of those countries . Kenyans are feeling the pinch at the moment but it is nothing compared to the fate that has befallen other nations . <p> Second , the KCCB statement reveals an economy of truth that could pass for sophism . This is seen when the bishops allege that " faith-based organisations are owed billions in dues by the government , " a situation they have claimed to have " addressed constantly even with the President , to no avail . " These statements are negated by the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defunct " National Health Insurance Fund owed hospitals Sh9 billion out of which Sh7.58 billion had been mobilised in the last month to pay the debts . " <p> As these and other gaps in the KCCB statement are revealed , a question arises : Did the bishops do their due diligence before their press conference or were they simply regurgitating the country 's political opposition 's spiel ? It would serve authority figures well , especially revered clergymen , to be more circumspect about their public utterances .

And currently has capacity to produce up to 75 million doses of vaccines that are also sold to private veterinarians , counties , as well as exported to countries in Africa and beyond . <p> The CS told livestock farmers that the government means well in carrying out the vaccination exercise and that KEVEVAPI , which has been around since 1964 , has the expertise and facilities to produce fifteen ( 15 ) livestock vaccines that are considered important in the Country and internationally . <p> " The vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to ensure that all are comfortable so we are engaging the County Governments and stakeholders , as we roll out this exercise and so am urging farmers to come out in large numbers and offer their animals to be vaccinated , " the CS said . <p> Director of Veterinary Services ( DVS ) Dr Allan Azegele said this is the first time in the country that the government has deliberately taken steps towards facilitating vaccination programmes for animals in the country . <p> He thanked the government for this and noted that they were keen to ensure that all livestock keepers are sensitised about the vaccination programme . <p> " We have been undertaking awareness programmes through County teams led by the Directors responsible for extension and we will even be engaging them further as we approach the roll out of the vaccination , " he said . <p> Dr Azegele assured farmers that the vaccines have been produced in Kenya and that the DVS undertook quality assurance of all the vaccines used . <p> " The Director has the authority under the law and has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs or animal feeds that are used in production because health of the animal is critical to growth of the livestock sector in the country , " he said . <p> The DVS called upon farmers to be ready and available , present their animals for vaccination once the programme is rolled out saying , " This programme is premised on the mantra prevention is better than cure . It is cheaper to prevent disease from causing infection in the animals , it will be productive and you will earn more money " . <p> An outbreak of any notifiable disease in the country is likely to wipe out the livestock affected and lead to great losses due to loss of production , loss of export markets and cost of the sanitary measures taken to contain the disease <p> The Government , through the Bottom-up Economic Transformation Agenda ( BETA ) , aims to turn around the economy through a value chain approach and in the State Department for Livestock under the agriculture pillar , it aims to improve productivity in dairy , meat and leather value chains .
