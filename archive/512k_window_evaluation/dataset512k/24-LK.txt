@@104816233 <h> VAT 0n Jewellery <p> Overall , the introduction of the 18% VAT on gold and jewellery in Sri Lanka is likely to have a mixed bag of observations . While it could generate revenue for the government , it also carries the risk of increasing gold prices , reducing demand , and impacting individuals and communities . <p> It 's important to monitor the situation closely and assess the long-term impacts on the various stakeholders involved . Policymakers might need to consider adjustments or support mechanisms to mitigate negative consequences . <p> As of January 1st , 2024 , both the import of gold coins and the supply of locally manufactured jewellery are subject to a Value Added Tax ( VAT ) of 18% in Sri Lanka . This is a significant change from the previous regulations , which exempted these items from VAT . <p> Here 's a Breakdown of the New VAT Rule and its Implications <p> What it means : <p> ? For Importers of Gold Coins : Any gold coins imported into Sri Lanka after January 1st , 2024 , will be subject to an 18% VAT on top of the customs duty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Locally Made Jewellery : All locally manufactured jewellery sold after January 1st , 2024 , will be subject to an 18% VAT . This means that jewellery manufacturers and sellers will need to account for this additional cost when pricing their products .

Customers : The price of gold coins and locally manufactured jewellery is likely to increase due to the new VAT . This could impact consumer demand for these items . ? Businesses : Jewellery manufacturers and sellers will need to adjust their accounting and pricing practices to comply with the new VAT regulations . They may also need to educate their customers about the price increase . ? Government : The new VAT is expected to generate additional revenue for the Sri Lankan government .

Reduced Profit Margins : Jewellery businesses can not import jewellery , and therefore are unable to get Tax Invoices for their original gold purchases from the Central Bank and other authorized importers . Thereby , they are unable to offset the 18% VAT they pay on inputs against the VAT they collect on output ( jewellery sales ) .

Reduced Investment and Growth : The squeezed margins and increased complexity may discourage investment in the jewellery sector , hindering both its growth and potential job creation . <p> Impact on Customers <p> ? Higher Jewellery Prices : To maintain profitability , businesses are likely to pass on the increased cost of production due to the unclaimable input tax , by raising jewellery prices . This could make jewellery less affordable for some customers . ? Reduced Demand : Higher prices could lead to decreased demand for jewellery , impacting business revenue and potentially leading to job losses . ? Shift to Informal Market : Customers seeking to avoid the higher prices may turn to the informal market , where VAT regulations may not be strictly enforced .

Reducing the VAT rate on jewellery : A lower VAT rate could lessen the impact on both businesses and customers , although it would also generate less revenue for the government . ?

This could lead to lower revenue for importers and retailers : If the demand falls , businesses might experience reduced revenue and profits . Shift Towards Alternatives Customers might turn to cheaper alternatives like silver or costume jewellery . ? Possible Black Market Activity : In extreme cases , high prices and limited access could incentivize informal markets for gold trading , posing concerns about authenticity and regulations .

@@104816234 <h> The Prestige And Hope That A-Levels Bring ! - EDITORIAL <p> The General Certificate of Education ( GCE ) Advanced Level Examination began on January 4 ( Thursday ) with candidates sitting for the examination while carrying high hopes for the future . It is important that these candidates go to the examination centres with a positive frame of mind because education is now perceived as a long journey where the end part of it might even be completed in a foreign country . The present situation in Sri Lanka is bleak with the rulers squeezing the ' life ' out of citizens by imposing so many taxes and making living in the island close to unthinkable . But when students accomplish the plan of successfully passing this examination they can see beyond the horizons of this island . <p> In the past there were those who passed the A-Level examination and gained university admission and those who did n't . Now there are two different categories ; those who are fortunate to continue school education and sit for the A-Level examination and those who have been forced to drop out of school because supporting the educating phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago there were several newspaper articles touching on the subject where parents took turns in sending their children to school when the family was large and the income generated by the breadwinner or both parents combined was low . Still , as many as 346,976 candidates have registered for the A-Level examination , out of which 65,531 candidates are sitting for the examination in a private capacity . Now that 's interesting ! <p> This means that the local A-Levels are still pursued as an important phase in education . Qualifying for a local university is still considered as prestigious even though branches of foreign universities are mushrooming here in the island and are promising a professional qualification at competitive prices . In these branches of foreign universities , courses are conducted by academics who love both teaching and children . And given that there are no strikes in these private universities , courses are completed within the stipulated time . Regular strikes and inhuman ragging at local universities have acted as deterrents when it comes to taking a decision whether to study at a state institute here or continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach in them are held in high regard by the public . These university academics took to strike action last year and the outcome was a delay in the release of the A-Level examination results . The strike by the dons was connected to tax issues . <p> The local A-Level examination is considered by many as a ' highly competitive national test ' . This is because those who obtain the right ' Z Score ' can complete a degree programme at a reputed state university for free . Students also receive the Mahapola Bursary ; even though inadequate , it is the first real grant by the state to further higher education . All this is possible if a candidate does well at this competitive examination and qualifies to say that he or she belongs within the cream of the country 's students . If one recalls the results from last year 's A-Level batch , as many as 166,938 candidates qualified for university admission ; which in percentage form was 63.3% . That 's impressive ! <p> Students get to sit for the A-Levels in streams like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Technology . A good number of students say that these streams are not the desired or dream paths for them when planning for the future . But these are the only ' vehicles ' available within the local education curriculum to keep moving in school education and not hit a snag . One has to be really bold these days to drop out of the A-Level class at school or university because these two stages in education are safe paths and guarantee results . The ' colours ' of A-Level education are pretty much the same despite new subjects being added to the curriculum . Those who find this stage of education boring can do so only if they have the capacity to think of a ' new ' colour .

After all , the 1975 resolution ( 3379 ) was spearheaded by mostly NAM nations . Most Arab and Islamic countries voted against the resolution , arguing that Israel was continuing its atrocities against the Palestinians in occupied territories . Joining the Arab and Islamic countries were four other non-Muslim nations : Sri Lanka , North Korea , Cuba , and Vietnam . <p> Sri Lanka took the moral high ground in support of the Palestinians ' right to statehood and freedom and insisted that Zionism was indeed a form of racism .

This was after Washington said it could supply weapons to Sri Lanka only with India 's consent , which was then unthinkable given New Delhi 's open support for Sri Lanka 's separatist rebels . Sri Lanka was to later learn that the Israelis were not only training Sri Lankan troops but also the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , as revealed by Victor Ostrovsky , a former Mossad officer , in his 1991 bestseller ' By Way of Deception .

It votes for UN resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza , but at the same time sends thousands of Sri Lankan workers to support Israel 's war economy .

Manjusri , in Mahayana Buddhism , is a Bodhisattva ( a Buddha-to-be ) personifying supreme wisdom . His name in Sanskrit means " gentle , or sweet , glory " . In China he is called Wen-shu Shih-li .

The originator of the line of patriarchs in some cases could even be the Buddha . <p> The Tentai school is based on the Lotus Surtra ( Saddharmapundarika sutra ) , which teaches that everybody can attain Buddhahood , just as they are , in this lifetime . A person only needs to follow the Bodhisattva path -- taking compassionate action for others , based on the recognition that true happiness for oneself is impossible while others suffer . <p> The Qing tu ( Pure Land doctrine ) is the basis for the cult of Buddha Amitabha who dwells in the Western Paradise of Sukhavati .

Now there are only a very few British protectorates left , including the Falklands Islands .

The first was that Sri Lanka hadsaman gained Independence from Britain just six years earlier , in 1948 .

Then we compare the two , " the professor revealed . <p> What does the inscription say ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the inscription says about an offering to Buddhist monks . Offerings of caves , and the construction and offering of a stupa is mentioned here . Also , there it mentions the construction of a road and supply of water . <p> The professor also said that names of historical figures are mentioned in the inscription . There are male and female names mentioned in the inscription and some of them could be historical figures we all know such as King Devanampiyathissa , his brother Surathissa , or his father Mutasiva . We need more studies and the expert knowledge of historians to find out who these characters are . Names such as Aya Thisa , Aya Sura Thisa , and Aya Siva could be members of the Anuradhapura Royal Family . " <p> Answering a question the professor said that there is no evidence to link the inscription to Gautama Buddha nor does it say that the Buddha or his relatives lived in Sri Lanka . <p> We can not give instant results when we are reading and interpreting an ancient inscription . It takes time to analyse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscription and a fascinating discovery considering its size , " Prof. Hettiarachchi said . <p> Prof. Hettiarachchi also said that the inscription looks very neat compared to many other early Brahmi inscriptions in Sri Lanka . The lines seem to be neat and the letters are neat too and carved in similar sizes . In other early Brahmi inscriptions ( in Sri Lanka ) , the letters are of different sizes and also the lines are not on a straight manner ( We have explained this in one of our previous heritage articles ) . <p> Also , there can be seen many ' Upper Case ' letters in this inscription which is unique and rare in Brahmi inscriptions in Sri Lanka . Considering all these facts , we can say that an expert in inscriptions and language has written and carved this inscription and also learned people must have lived in this area during that time , Prof. Hettiarachchi elaborated . <p> He also explained that the inscription could be narrating about a banking system that was in use in ancient Sri Lanka . He compared this inscription with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Thonigala Inscription which mention details about Sri Lanka 's ancient banking system . <p> He also said that considering the surrounding ancient landscape of the vicinity , this inscription must have been a part of a vast spread of ancient settlements including monasteries , and human settlements . <p> The history of Dimbulagala <p> The history of Dimbulagala dates back to the earliest days of Sri Lankan history . According to the Mahavamsa , the Great Chronicle , Dimbulagala is referred to as ' Dumrak Gala ' . The chronicle says that Dumrak Gala was an important fortress during the battle of King Pandukabhaya against his uncles . <p> Later , it became a Buddhist monastery . <p> The Late Professor Anuradha Seneviratna writes in Polonnaruwa ; Medieval Capital of Sri Lanka ( 1998 ) , Dimbulagala is a cave temple dating back to the early centuries of Sri Lankan history . A fair number of inscriptions in Brahmi were discovered from Maravidiya , Kosgoda Ulpota , Namalpokuna , and Pulligoda -- Galge giving details about the early cave residences of the hermit monks of Sri Lanka . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He further writes , Dimbulagala , in early times , was known differently as Dhumarakkhababbata or Udumbarapabbata or Udumbarasalapabbata . During the Anuradhapura Period , there was an important vihara and the Pali commentaries too refer to this sacred place . <p> The most remarkable contribution came from Parakramabahu the Great in the 12th century . He carried out a purification of the Buddhist order with the help of Maha Kassapa Maha Thera then residing in Udumbaragiri or Dimbulagala . " <p> Prof. Seneviratna says that the Bhikkus at Dimbulagala were always assiduous in contemplation and study and in training their pupils to lead a religious life . The learned monks at Dimbulagala gave all possible assistance to King Parakramabahu in his religious undertakings . <p> Dimbulagala ( caves in Maravidiya and Pulligoda ) is also famous for the exquisite wall paintings found at the place that have been dated to the Polonnaruwa Period , by art historians . <p> Prof. Hettiarachchi said that during his stay at Dimbulagala , Prince Pandukabhya ( 5th century BCE ) was preparing for a great battle . According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of Juthindhara Yakkha helped the prince . The Mahavamsa says that she was a horse-mare . The professor said that by calling her a horse mare , the chroniclers must have meant that Chethiya was a strong and powerful woman . <p> Pandukabhaya would not have settled here and prepared for war if this area was an abandoned , isolated area . We understand that this was a part of the early urban civilisation of Rajarata and that iron production was done in this area . Prof. Nimal Silva says that Yaksha is the people who were engaged in iron production ( Yakada ) . Pandukabhaya needed strong weapons and armour for the battle and thus , he must have settled in Dimbulagala and worked with Yakshas ( those who were engaged in iron production and were strong people ) to make his weapons and armour . A large amount of iron production sites were discovered in this area during a survey conducted by the DoA . <p> Prof. Hettiarachchi also explained that great monks who were renowned all over the country for their wisdom , Dhamma knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . He stated evidence from ancient literature sources such as the Asgiri Thalpatha , Mahavamsa , Saddharmarathnakaraya and Rasavahini . <p> We are doing research about the Dimbulagala Rock Inscription and the surrounding area .

@@106200240 <h> By Katherine J. Cramer and Jonathan D. Cohen Courtesy NewsIn.Asia <p> New York , February 21 ( New York Times ) : When asked what drives the economy , many Americans have a simple , single answer that comes to mind immediately : greed . " They believe the rich and powerful have designed the economy to benefit themselves and have left others with too little or with nothing at all . <p> We know Americans feel this way because we asked them . Over the past two years , as part of a project with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , we and a team of people conducted over 30 small-group conversations with Americans from almost every corner of the country . While national indicators may suggest that the economy is strong , the Americans we listened to are mostly not thriving . They do not see the economy as nourishing or supporting them . Instead , they tend to see it as an obstacle , a set of external forces out of their control that nonetheless seems to hold sway over their lives . <p> Take the perceived prevalence of greed . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently by inflation and higher housing costs . Americans experience these phenomena not as abstract concepts or political talking points but rather as grocery stores and landlords demanding more money . <p> Income inequality has been in decline over the last few years . But try explaining that to someone struggling to pay the rent . I just feel like the underdog ca n't get ahead , and it 's all about greed and profit , " one Kentucky participant noted . It is not necessarily the actual distribution of wealth that troubles people . It is the feeling that the economy is rigged against them . <p> There is a clear disconnect between the macroeconomic story and the micro-American experience . While a tight job market has produced historic gains for lower-income workers , many of the low-income workers we spoke with are unable to accumulate enough money to build a safety net for themselves . I like the feeling of not living on the edge of disaster , " a special-education teacher in rural Tennessee said . I am at my fullest potential economically " right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being there , and pretty much most people I know are . " <p> If there is a singular explanation for dissatisfaction with the economy , it is a lack of financial certainty . While direct government assistance early in the pandemic certainly helped many in 2020 and 2021 , millions of households still struggled to get food , and many millions fell behind on rent . These feelings of instability do not dissipate quickly , especially when rising prices make trips to the store adventures in budgetary arithmetic and the threat of an accident or a surprise medical bill looms around every corner . Uncertainty really affects your well-being . It affects what you do . It affects how you behave , " said a unionized airport worker in Virginia who tutors in the evenings . <p> An absence of economic resilience prevents people from spending time with family , from getting involved in their community and from finding ways to build a safety net . The way the economy is going right now , you do n't know where it 's going to be tomorrow , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well-being is about being financially stable . It 's not about being rich , but it 's about being able to take care of your everyday needs without stressing . " <p> Stress is a rampant part of American life , much of it caused by financial insecurity . Some people aspire for the mansion on the hill . Many others are looking just to get their feet on solid ground . <p> One does not need to look hard beyond traditional metrics to see the prevalence of insecurity . In June an industry report found that auto loan delinquencies were higher than they were at the peak of the Great Recession . Credit card use has swelled , and delinquencies are at among their highest rates in a decade . After hitting a historic low in 2021 thanks to the expansion of the child tax credit , child poverty more than doubled in 2022 after the tax credit 's expansion expired . Also in 2022 , rates of food insecurity reached their highest levels since 2015 . <p> Major role , too . In some parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been left out of the progress and promise of the high-tech economy . Even if their finances remain in good health , they seem to fear for the future of their community , and they blame the economy . <p> The political system is supposed to make all this better . Instead , even as both major parties have vied to cast themselves as the standard-bearer of the working class , many Americans see politicians as unable or unwilling to do anything to help them . In my democracy , I 'd like to see us get rid of Republicans , Democrats , " one Kentucky participant told us . Just stand up there , tell me what you can do . If you can do it , I do n't have to care what you are . " Many Americans seem to see Washington as awash in partisan squabbles over things that have little effect on their lives . Many believe that politicians are looking out for their political party , not the American people . <p> It should not be surprising , then , that so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising gross domestic product lifts lots of boats , but many Americans feel as if they are drowning . <p> What would make the people we talked to less stressed ? The ability to accumulate savings . Low-wage workers have seen their incomes rise only for many of these gains to be wiped out by inflation . And the costs of housing , health care and child care can quickly absorb even a very robust rainy-day fund . Without a safety net that can propel people into security , the threat of these costs will continue to make many Americans feel unstable , uncertain and decidedly unhappy about the economy . <p> A helpful starting point would be to address benefit cliffs -- income eligibility cutoffs built into certain benefits programs . As households earn more money , they can make themselves suddenly ineligible for benefits that would let them build up enough wealth to no longer need any government support . In Kansas , for example , a family of four remains eligible for Medicaid as long as it earns under $39,900 . A single dollar in additional income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative will certainly not cost only a buck . <p> forming these types of cliffs for health care , child care , housing and food assistance programs would allow the millions of households receiving state aid to achieve a sense of stability . Take this mother in Chicago who told us that her income is just above the eligibility cutoffs . The cliff knocks me out of a lot of the opportunity to qualify for a lot of the programs that could assist in benefiting myself and my child , " she said . <p> The Americans we listened to want resiliency so they can feel that they are in control of their lives and that they have a say in the direction of their community and their nation . They want a system focused less on how the economy is doing and more on how Americans are doing . As one Houston man observed : We 're so far down on the economic chain that we do n't have nothing . It seems like our voices do n't matter . " But they do matter .

@@107002239 <h> Aswesuma : Enhancing results by reducing indicators <p> In contrast to the eligibility criteria used by Samurdhi , the Aswesuma criteria reflect greater sensitivity to the multiple interlinked deprivations that constitute and contribute to poverty Photo by Pradeep Pathirana <p> Aswesuma is the most recent welfare benefits programme introduced by the government of Sri Lanka . It replaces the Samurdhi scheme and is the result of a necessary condition to be fulfilled by the government of Sri Lanka in the loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Aswesuma provides targeted assistance to vulnerable groups by reducing poverty ; its goal is to enhance social welfare and support household resilience at a time of economic instability . The recent months have given us a glimpse into Aswesuma in action , and brought to the forefront questions about whether those who are most in need of welfare benefits are receiving assistance , and how eligibility is determined . Simplifying the approach that is currently used to assess Aswesuma eligibility is key to addressing these questions ; with both efficacy and efficiency at stake , the timely adoption of an alternative to the current resource-intensive methodology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Aswesuma is assessed using a Multidimensional Poverty Index ( MPI ) . In contrast to the eligibility criteria used by its predecessor Samurdhi , the Aswesuma criteria reflect greater sensitivity to the multiple interlinked deprivations that constitute and contribute to poverty . Aswesuma assesses deprivations across six dimensions : education , health , economic level assets , housing condition , and family demography . A prospective beneficiary is assessed based on their self-reported responses to questions relating to 22 indicators , which are distributed across the six dimensions . While MPIs are good at measuring poverty , they are typically less suitable for targeting welfare assistance . This is because , when the applicant 's responses are tied to direct cash benefits , the indicators that are used must also carry certain other special attributes . We must ask , for example , how easy is it to verify the response to a given indicator ? And what is the possibility of misrepresenting or falsifying this information ( which depends both on how easy it is to falsify/misrepresent information , and how likely it is that information will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing the most immediate objective of Aswesuma -- targeting those who are most in need of welfare assistance -- but also opens itself up to a costly data collection exercise , which misdirects funds away from the intended beneficiaries . These are implications which the government simply can not afford at this time . <p> Rethinking the indicators <p> Let us illustrate by looking at two of the 22 indicators that are currently used to determine Aswesuma eligibility : first , the monthly electricity consumption of a household , and second , the average monthly income of the household . In the case of the electricity consumption indicator , the cost of verification of household usage is low , because an electricity bill provides this information . Equally -- and perhaps more importantly -- the possibility and the probability of misrepresentation or falsification of this information is also low . Therefore , electricity consumption can be classified as a near ideal-type indicator : that is , one that displays high ease of verification , low possibility of falsification and low likelihood of falsification . A detailed analysis of the utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Electricity Consumption is a Superior Method , a background note published by Verit ? Research in 2022 . In contrast to monthly household electricity consumption , monthly household income is precisely the type of indicator that becomes problematic in the context of determining eligibility for welfare benefits . Based on the criteria that is currently used to determine Aswesuma eligibility , a household is identified as poor if its monthly income is less than a pre-determined cut-off point ( which is established based on the official poverty line published by DCS ) . However , given the self-reported nature of this information , the ease of verification is low ; additionally , the ease of misrepresentation or falsification , and the likelihood of misrepresentation or falsification , are both high . Therefore , requesting this type of data from a prospective recipient of welfare benefits serves next to no useful purpose , and in fact increases the vulnerabilities that are built into the targeting mechanism . What about indicators that are more costly to verify -- for example , where verification requires a visit by a government representative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housing condition dimension , for example , require this type of verification . Assuming the government is willing and able to bear the cost of verification , when combined with both low ease of falsification , and low likelihood of falsification , these indicators also emerge as strong indicators in the context of determining eligibility for welfare benefits . Using this approach , the list of 22 indicators that is currently used to determine Aswesuma eligibility can be refined down to 10 indicators . While remaining true to its roots -- specifically , the commitment to recognise poverty and deprivation in its multiple forms -- this streamlined list of indicators represents a less resource intensive and more reliable approach for determining Aswesuma eligibility . <p> Indicators : More is not better <p> Indicators play a crucial role in enabling social protection programmes such as Aswesuma to do their job . Getting the indicators right is an imperative , as is revising and refining them in order to improve their efficacy . This article offers a very preliminary indication of what such an approach might look like . Rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprising half the number of indicators would not only do the job of determining eligibility , but also do it better , by providing a more efficient framework for targeting beneficiaries .

@@107002240 <h> Education reforms : A distant goal for Sri Lanka ? <p> Sri Lanka 's education system has been yearning for reforms following the millennium if one had closely observed the ever-transforming education sectors in developed countries . The discourse to bring about education reforms has continued for decades . As a result , the government has drafted a National Education Policy Framework ( NEPF ) for a 10-year period from 2023-2033 . But , academics observe that this is a loosely drafted document that has n't addressed several key areas of concern . The Executive Summary states that Sri Lanka 's education system is heavy on content and examination-driven , thereby selecting a small percentage of students on to an academic path . The competition created as a result of an education system that spoon-feeds children on content has done more harm than good . As a result , children are more inclined to study theory and they do n't develop any ethics or moral values as they have limited interactions with one another . More than the students , it is the parents who run around ensuring that their children are the best ; paying thumping amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter Grade 1 ! <p> Poor quality standards of teaching maintained in rural schools have led many children to dropout or omit certain subjects which are considered important , such as English and Mathematics . Discrepancies in the distribution of facilities in National and Provincial schools , differentiation of schools based on religion and language have created a further divide among families who can afford to provide a quality education for their children versus families who can barely afford to send their children to school . The NEPF further states that ' a transformation of education can not be envisioned without an understanding of emerging technologies including Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) , climate change etc . ' But prior to introducing AI to schools , one needs to reminisce the days of the pandemic when children in rural areas could barely afford a smartphone to follow online classes ! Even if they did have smartphones , most children had poor reception . The situation has n't changed from then to now , and most schools do n't even have a computer lab in the first place . So without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children could grasp the complexities of AI remains a question . Many have blamed the lack of a poor education system as being a root cause for the soaring number of cases related to child abuse , harassment and rape . For the longest time , child rights activists and lawyers have been demanding to introduce sexual education as a compulsory subject in the school curricula . But it is a known fact that teachers tend to avoid this particular section in the biology class . When a fundamental subject had taken years to be integrated into existing curricula , there certainly seems to be limited scope for change . The NEPF identifies that the absence of a formal system to transfer from school to vocational education leads students to leave school and find employment without sufficient training . A strong education system would ultimately produce a highly skilled workforce in any country . But the prevailing education system has failed to address this need of the hour . Plans are afoot to recruit more teachers to develop estate sector schools , but it has now come to light that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another area of concern given that many children with special needs do n't have an opportunity to learn with other children . Concepts such as shadow teaching have been introduced in many private education institutions from primary level . Teachers need to be trained to international standards of teaching while the government should also look at recruiting counselors and trained psychologists in schools . This will help children to be more open about matters that worry them ; thereby giving them the space to bring up matters that they would n't want to speak with their parents or friends . The NEPF has addressed certain areas of concern from the periphery . But without a detailed outlook on matters of serious concern , this policy document would be another one that would gather dust in time to come . However , it is high time that the government now moves to bring about a holistic education system to produce skilled individuals with moral and ethical values to society , rather than programmed , inhuman , anti-social robots .

Although the Excise Department expected 217 billion rupees , the total revenue received was 171 billion rupees in 2023 .

In order to reach this , an amount of 1093 billion rupees has to be increased compared to the previous year .

@@109294230 <h> Every minute , 20 people are forced to flee as refugees <p> Sri Lanka is one of the countries worst affected by the refugee crisis largely due to the civil war that lasted about 25 years . The root causes for this included political , educational and economic issues with the United National Party governments working according to the globalised market economy system . This was aggravated by the Executive Presidential system which was introduced by J.R . Jayewardene government on February 4 , 1978 . Since then , the Executive Presidential system has come under widespread criticism so much so that in the 1994 Presidential Election , one of the main candidates , Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga , promised to abolish it within 24 hrs . She described it as a curse . But as for most politicians , power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely . So the curse apparently became a blessing and she continued with the Executive Presidential system . <p> It exists even today with President Ranil Wickremesinghe being elected to the post by Parliament on the recommendation of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who quit halfway through his term when the people 's movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew out of Sri Lanka in the night . Laws have been enacted and practical steps taken to dissolve the refugee and related crises , but as usual , little progress has been made , largely because most leading politicians make big promises in election campaigns , but they are often not kept . We hope President Wickremesinghe will take a different path and practise what he preaches for the sake of future generations and Sri Lanka 's geopolitical strategies and security . Today ( 20 ) , the United Nations ( UN ) marks World Refugee Day and Sri Lanka needs to give high priority to the issue whatever elections are held and when they may be held . World Refugee Day , which falls on June 20 , is an international day designated by the UN to honour refugees around the globe .

Both are factors which will shape our futures . Though we can not be proud of the post D.S. Senanayake era , we did have a past where Sri Lanka , or Ceylon then , was very much on the world map for all the good reasons .

Hence , paying taxes is nothing new to Sri Lankans . <p> When you study the elected regimes that were in power and the kingdoms before that , the authorities in this island had a Buddhist way of thinking and the people 's welfare at heart when engaging in administration .

This regime knows that without close links with Buddhism and the saffron robed clergy , no regime can have a smooth run in administrating this country . Buddhism teaches us compassion as much as it stresses on impermanence . History shows us that Sinhala-Buddhist rulers were inclined towards people 's welfare , but this aspect was absent when Tamil Kings with a Hindu lineage ruled this island on and off . People 's welfare has always been top priority of Sinhala-Buddhist Kings , but not necessarily with Kings who practised the Hindu faith .

The First Citizen of this country reiterates that he will build an economy that will enhance production and reduce imports . Wickremesinghe 's mingling with the downtrodden masses is however seen as an election gimmick . This is because the Wickremesinghe regime , akin to the two Rajapaksa regimes , believes in selling or leasing state properties or borrowing ' brains ' from Indians and the Chinese to develop this nation . The present regime has to cater to the interest of China and India among other powerful nations before it caters to the interest of the masses .

History gives us enough examples as to how kings lost power when they neglected the temple and the welfare of the people . King Udaya the 3rd killed rebel ministers inside a monastery and earned the wrath of the people . The people revolted and the King went into hiding . The authority that the Buddhist temple generated held sway over the King 's authority or rule in the country .

@@109294234 <p> The Economic Transformation Bill could create an oasis in an island of bad governance , sparking uncertainty among foreign investors and threatening the flow of crucial investments , warn legal and investment experts . <p> The recently gazetted impractical Economic Transformation Bill is set to repeal the Board of Investment ( BOI ) of Sri Lanka Law , No. 4 of 1978 , and replace the BOI with the Economic Commission of Sri Lanka .

Is he aware that certain retired police officers who joined the ranks of NPP , in their newspaper articles written in English had cleared the names of those politicians named by Anura Kumara as masterminds of that heinous crime ?

Sajith Premadasa visiting Kilinochchi on 16 June , declared his intention to implement the 13th Amendment in full ; Abraham Sumanthitharan was in attendance . <p> On the following day Anura Kumara was in Jaffna ; he had a private meeting with Sumanthitharan ; Sumanthitharan said afterwards that during his discussions Anura Kumara had admitted that the Tamils should have the right to decide on their requirements and admitted that Provincial Councils had failed to provide solutions to the problems of the Tamil people ; later in London Anura Kumara said that they will continue with the Provincial Councils . He said that it is in the law . We do not intend to repeat again and again the atrocities committed by the JVP/DJV during 1988/1989 opposing the 13th Amendment and Provincial Councils . <p> Thus TNA received assurances from all three contenders as regards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going beyond it to solve the ethnic crisis " , all trying to win North and East votes ; but RW is having an advantage over the other two because he was the person who signed the Norwegian crafted 2002 Ceasefire Agreement ( CFA ) acting above the President at the time CBK ; recently Sumanthitharan regretted the LTTE- TNA joint decision to boycott 2005 Presidential Elections which caused as some say RW 's defeat , giving an advantage to MR . <p> After Sajith Premadasa ' s visit , G.L. Pieris visited Jaffna to promote Premadasa 's candidature ; he said that he would not give empty promises ; Pieris who supported CBK , RW , MR , GR and Dulles in his earlier political avatars is the ideal person to woo Tamils . Tamil separatists have a rapport with him as RW 's chief negotiator with Tigers . These are the games academic- politicians play aiming a National List slot that will culminate with the coziest seat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whoever at the helm . <p> But S. Sritharan , the newly elected leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the Tamils . All others also reject it . What do Premadasa and Anura Kumara going to do ? Are they going to have a referendum as in South Sudan , Timor etc. and create a separate state amalgamating the North and the East ? <p> All three contenders promise to hold Provincial Councils elections ; but people have not forgotten who supported the postponement of Provincial Councils elections ; RW , SP , AKD and TNA together passed an amendment to the Provincial Councils Elections Act to put off Provincial Councils elections indefinitely . <p> Sajith Premadasa visiting Jaffna in mid-June said he is going to develop North , then the North could contribute more to the GDP ; now lowest province compared to Western , Central and North Western provinces he said . He promised to establish international cricket stadia , one in Jaffna and another in Batticaloa .

This will be discussed under Ranil 's StrategicManeuvers in the next part of this series . <p> On 2 July 2024 , RW after his special address in the Parliament paid a tribute to Sampanthan the late leader of the TNA ; Sajith Premadasa replying to RW also wanted to pay his condolences and a verbal battle followed with the Speaker , despite Speaker 's assurance that a special day will be allotted for parliamentarians to pay their respects to the dead leader of the TNA ; anyway like a kid who grabbed a balloon Premadasa succeeded . <p> Both speakers said Sampanthan worked for territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka , forgetting how TNA under his leadership acted as the mouthpiece of LTTE , condoning all atrocities committed by it . <p> On 3 July 2024 , when the body of Sampanthan was brought to the Parliament Anura Kumara was seen meekly escorting the coffin as if he was the cross-bearer in a Christian funeral procession rather than a pallbearer ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds and state machinery ; SJB promises a mid-day meal to all school children ; distributing busses and smart class rooms " he has become a joke , writingcat sat on a mat " , something in Tamil , drawing diagrams ondigital boards , asking the children whether they know Japanese . The school children especially primary school children can not stomach what Premadasa lectures ; he does not have any knowledge of the audience he addresses ; he does not understand that the macro level politics and economics he preaches are not suitable to his audience ; the most harmful aspect of his lectures is the weightage he gives to English and IT , creating confusion , ambiguity , anxiety , discontent , frustration , maladjustment and alienation among rural and semi- urban children . His utterances about knowledge-based economy , human capital are not novel concepts although he dramatizes them in front of empty receptacles . Why the government and the Ministry of Education allow him to play political games with school children , teachers and parents ? Does RW think that he has given Premadasa an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman alleged what Premadasa uses is casino money . <p> Both SJB and NPP promise to tackle corruption , waste and mismanagement and to punish wrongdoers ; all these promises are populist and unrealistic ; both do not address the real economic issues . Both promise to investigate Easter Sunday carnage ; Premadasa has forgotten that he was in the Yahapalana government when Easter Sunday massacre took place ; Anura Kumara has forgotten that the NPP had accommodated Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim , one of the country 's richest spice exporters in its 2015 national list , that his two sons Iham Ahmad Ibrahim and Imsath Ahmad denotated their explosives at the Shangri-La and Cinnamon Grand Hotel respectively and daughter- in- law denotated a bomb at Dematagoda . <p> Both SJB and NPP support RW 's Gender Equality Bill .

@@110027235 <h> Sugath Kulatunga <p> I agree totally with my Senior colleague at Arunachalam Hall who on 24 February pointed out on the LBN the dangers of unbridled power enjoyed and abused by the Central Bank ( CBSL ) . They relished this privilege even before the recent IMF inspired independence . It was the mandarins of the CBSL who controlled both the monetary policy and the fiscal policy of the country by hogging the top positions of both the Monetary Board and the Ministry of Finance . It is this unholy alliance that resorted to profligate borrowing , which stifled development and bankrupted the country . <p> At present the Central Bank has been provided with an ' autonomy ' by the new Central Bank Act which says that the : <p> 1 ) The Central Bank shall have administrative and financial autonomy . <p> ( 2 ) The Central Bank shall be autonomous and accountable . <p> The Act fails to specify the ' accountability ' requirement leaving the CBSL to interpret it to their advantage like on policy on salaries . <p> CBSL has nearly 1000 professionals under one roof . Even before the present pay hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The CBSL raised the salaries of its staff by between 29.53% ( most junior office assistants ) and 76.97% for its highest grade of Deputy Governor . With the revision an office assistant ( KKS ) gets a monthly salary of 198,000 while a Deputy Governor collects a cool Rs 1.7 million . This lavish pay hike will result in CBSL 's monthly salary bill rise by 50 percent . This is done while making substantial losses . CBSL staff are entitled to foreign training , mostly leading to a PhD . Their posts are pensionable and are also covered with a provident fund where the CBSL contribution is a high 29 % . On top of all these they wallow in other perks like loans at interest rates as low as 1% . The public wishes to know whether the contribution of the CBSL to the nation is commensurate with these superlative rewards . <p> The recent history of this expensive so-called professional body has not been above board and blameless . Public is aware of the Greek Bond scandal and the the outragous Arjuna Mahendran bond scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rates of interest during the Yahapalana regime can not be swept under the carpet.It has now become the bone of contention . <p> State Minister of Finance tried to exculpate the CBSL on the astronomical pay hike , stating that the move targeted positions facing scarcity of replacements , to retain qualified personnel and insisted the necessity of competitive salaries to prevent talent drain from the Central Bank . <p> CBSL is staffed by economists specializing in banking , accounts , statistics etc . There is a surfeit of economists employed in the universities , as school teachers and in the public service and the private sector who would be happy to join the CBSL with the superlative salaries and perks . It is also a myth that a PhD is essential to serve in the CBSL . Mr.A.S . Jayawardhana who served the Bank with distinction as a Deputy Governor and Governor did not have a doctorate . He is credited with the successful restoration of the CBSL to normalcy after the disastrous LTTE bomb attack . <p> The departments of the Bank are grouped into four key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Financial System Stability Cluster , Agency Functions &amp; Corporate Services Cluster and Legal &amp; Enforcement Cluster . A department is headed by a Director ( or equivalent ) . By 2014 there were 27 Departments . Among the responsibilities of these Departments is the orderly and smooth functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market . This consist of activities such as ; <p> *Continuous monitoring of the foreign exchange operations of licensed commercial banks and National Savings Bank and Authorized Money Brokers Bank Supervision is a major function for which there is a separate department which is responsible for -the regulation and supervision of licensed banks by ; <p> Licensing of commercial banks and specialized banks in Sri Lanka and <p> Conducting continuous supervision of licensed banks and <p> Formulating and issuing prudential regulations to licensed banks . <p> Reviewing and amending the relevant Acts and regulations in line with current market developments , international standards and best practices . <p> On bank supervision the Foreign Exchange Act of 2017 provides the responsibility of the commercial banks to make prompt reports on foreign exchange transactions.At Article 80.

( Gazette 2145/49 -- THURSDAY , OCTOBER 17 , 2019 ) where every exporter of goods is required to repatriate to Sri Lanka payments received for the exportation of goods within 180 days from the date of exportation . <p> 1 .

All licensed banks shall submit reports to the Director of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as may be required from time to time and provide unencumbered access to the officers of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as may be authorized by the Governor or the Deputy Governor , as the case may be , to inspect or examine the records maintained under the Rule , and to examine and review all actions taken by such licensed banks in securing full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Rule shall apply in respect of all goods exported and where the hundred and eightieth ( 180th ) date from the date of the shipment and exports proceeds received to Sri Lanka on any date after 18 February 2021 . <p> The Central Bank has failed miserably to supevise the commercial banks and implement these regulations . The dereliction of this primary duty has been disastrous and led to the bankruptcy of the country . It is a 50 billion dollar felony . <p> This scam was the focus of the debate in Parliament on 23.8.23 where Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe , Minister of Justice repeated that according to a Global Integrity Report d during the last 22 years export proceed that should have been repatriated back to the country but not sent back was USD 53.5 billion . The Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance have been evasive on why no action is being taken to ensure that this vast sum which is more than the total amount of our foreign debt of 37 billion USD . The State Minister of Finance merely stated that the Central Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought back to Sri Lanka will be brought back . He added that the government can look into later what happened in the past but what is important now is to stabilize the economy . <p> The real reason why it will not happen is with the covenant the government has agreed with the IMF . These conditions are in the Attachment I. to the Letter of Intent dated March 6,2023 signed by both President Wickremesinghe and the Governor of the Central Bank Nandalal Weerasinghe in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies . AT Page 98 of the IMF Staff Report 23/116 , it is stipulated in Article 21 : <p> 21 . We will phase out the administrative measures imposed to support the balance of payments , including those introduced on an emergency basis , once conditions allow . These measures include import restrictions , exchange restrictions , multiple currency practices ( MCPs ) , and capital flow management ( CFM ) measures . ( ref footnote 36 ) <p> While the mentioned import restrictions , exchange restrictions , MCPs and CFMs could help mitigate FX shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a substitute for the comprehensive policy package and ongoing macroeconomic adjustment . We are committed to phasing these measures out as the balance of payments stabilizes . To this end , by June 2023 , we will prepare a plan for the phased removal of these measures during the program period as we make progress with achieving macroeconomic stability , particularly with respect to the exchange rate , debt sustainability , and financial stability , improved market access . <p> Reference foot note 36 the main CFM measures introduced or tightened in 2020-2022 and currently in force include : <p> ( i ) a repatriation requirement for exports of goods and services ; ( ii ) a surrender requirement for exporters on proceeds from exports of goods ; <p> ( iii ) a surrender requirement for banks on purchases of export proceeds ; <p> ( iv ) a surrender requirement for banks on purchases of inward worker remittances ; <p> ( v ) suspension of outward remittances on capital transactions ; <p> ( vi ) restrictions on purchases of Sri Lankan ISBs by local bank " . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **Letter of Intent dated March 6,2023 . There is no explanation why the regulations were not imposed earlier . The only explanation is that exporters , Commercial Banks and the CBSL are complicit in this swindle . It is too big to have escaped the clutches of politicians . <p> ** ( The letter of intent should have been signed by the President and the Prime Minister who is the head of the Parliament which has plenary power over finance . Governor Central Bank is only a functionary . ) <p> The tragedy is that opposition parties have not shown any concern on this scam and the NGOs which rush to the Supreme Court with fundamental rights of individuals do not seem to be interested in a fundamental right of the nation . The 50 billion dollar figure is the historical loss to the nation . It is estimated that around 4 billion dollars is the annual loss . The IMF facility is only 3.9 billion dollars . The total foreign debt of the country is 37 Billion dollars . <p> The legislation on the establishment of the CBSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central bank it would contribute to the development of the country . <p> In CAP 422 -monetary law ( 8th Rev. ) on the establishment and objectives of Central Bank , at chapter ( ii ) it is stipulated that inter alia that the- <p> Central Bank is charged with the duty of securing , so far as possible by action authorised by this Act , the following objectives , namely : -- <p> economic and price stability ; and financial system stability , with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka . It is clear that the ultimate objective is the development the productive resources of the country . <p> In the new CBSL Act , No. 16 of 2023 it is further confirmed at article 6 ( 3 ) on the Objects ( 3 ) Without prejudice to the attainment of its objects and subject to the provisions of this Act , the Central Bank shall support the general economic policy framework of the Government as provided for in any law . " It is in this broad context that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be evaluated . <p> Today there is no function or department to ensure promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka " as envisaged in the Monetary Law . In 1979 the CBSL had a Development Finance Department which was headed by V.K. Wickremesinghe . At that time the Export Promotion Secretariat had a close rapport with V.K and worked together tin the establishment of the Sri Lanka Export Credit Corporation ( SLECIC ) . V.K had a vision on development and was familiar with the radical and rapid development in the Far East . I recollect him saying that the island of Sri Lanka should follow the developments taking place in the Chinese Republic island of Taiwan which was similar in size and population and of economic background . Of course it was an unofficial comment . Since 2005 the Development function has been placed under the Ministry of Finance . <p> In recent times the banking sector in the country has faced serious problems . Non perfoming loans have increased . The only solution the Banks have is to invoke Pareto Execution . Banks have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have the competence to detect early signs of delinquency . The problems are more acute in the micro finance sector . It is the responsibility of the Central Bank to devise preventive systems and even train the Bank staff in their implementation . <p> The Chairman of the Ways and Means committee of the Parliament Patali Champika Ranawaka has stated that the annual loss to the country by misinvoicing is over 4 billion US dollars . The Central Bank has not shown much interest in reducing misinvoicing which is widely prevalent and is said to be carried out with the connivance of the customs and the commercial banks . <p> I can not but mention my disappointment with the Central Bank in my dealing with them in my capacity as the Director General of the Export Development Board . At the very inception the EDB had selected the Gems and Jewellery sector to be given high priority in export development . The EDB resuscitated the Blue Diamonds Ltd giving a boost to the diamond cutting industry . Heat treating machines were imported to support the value addtion to geuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gem cutting technology . There were two critical problems that the gems and jewelry industry faced at the time . <p> One was the severe competition that the local industrialists had from Thai nationals who had established themselves strongly in the gem mining centers and buying up the uncut gems and specially geuda . These were then exported legally and more illegally to Thailand where uncut stones were cut and geudas burned and converted to sapphires . The Thais had the financial strength to buy up massive stocks of geuda and uncut gems . The local industrialist did not have the financial strength to stock the raw material . At a meeting where the Governor of the Central Bank was present I explained this problem and proposed that the Central Bank should establish a special refinance scheme of Rs 500 million to meet this need . The Governor said that will increase the money supply in the country leading to inflation and other problems . I replied that the EDB will freeze that amount of funds which was held by the EDB in Bank deposits to prevent an increas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outcome was that Sri Lanka lost the opportunity to become a gems and jewelry center and our gems helped Thailand to become a premier center for gems and jewelry . <p> The second problem with our industry was the restrictions on gold import for manufacture of jewelry . Sometime in 1985 at my request the Acting Minister of Trade Mahendra Wijeratne took up with the Cabinet the problem of securing gold for the Jewellery Industry , at which the President JR had directed the Acting Minister to undertake a study of the Gold Trade in a few East Asian countries . The Acting Minister instructed me to do this study and he wanted a report submitted to the President at the following cabinet meeting . I told him my knowledge of gold was limited to what was said about the metal , in James Bond novel GoldFinger by Ian Fleming . Acting Minister who too was a 007 fan said that was more than enough and asked me to go ahead . <p> The Hong Kong Chinese are reputed to be very conservative investors . They do not trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . But gold is a solid investment , and the Chinese were willing to forgo the interest on Bank deposits , which was very small , and preferred to hold their investment in gold in the banks which were prepared to hold the gold on behalf of the investors . The investor had the right to get the gold back at any time . It was a win-win situation . It was the safest investment . Gold did not depreciate but appreciated against paper currencies . As proof of the gold deposit the investor was given a paper certificate and hence the gold in the Bank was called " Paper Gold " . The paper was also transferrable . Under this system gold was freely available in the country for the Jewellery industry . <p> It was also mentioned that it was encouraged by the government as paper gold mops up excess currency in the economy and reduces inflation . It was an efficient and transparent system . <p> I was told that the President JR liked the idea of paper gold , but the Central Bank had objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not be made a subject of any other agency . In fact , the US had restrictions on the ownership of gold until 1975 . <p> EDB had from its inception been debating with the Central Bank to make import of gold free for the jewelry industry . Other than this irrelevant statutory restriction the Central Bank had an obnoxious objection which was not openly disclosed , that India will not like it as it will encourage smuggling of gold to India . My answer was that if gold smuggling to India is done on a fair scale there would be less terrorism in the North . <p> It is a tragedy that the Central Bank with its 1000 professional staff has not contributed in proportion of their numbers and cost to the development of the country . It is conceded that a few individuals like Gamini Corea have excelled in the international arena . His valiant effort to introduce a New Economic Order was a failure and not even spoken about now . The collective contribution of the Central Bank for the development of the country does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva and SBD.de Silva . In their retirement Dr.Sandaratne and Dr.Wijewardhana are making a contribution than most of the staff of the present Central Bank . An organization which should have been the Think Tank of the country has turned out to be a den of lotus eaters . In recent years they have been responsible for several massive scams . It is they who borrowed on ISBs at high rates of interest which resulted in the crown achievement of the Bank to declare that Sri Lanka is bankrupt . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@110027236 <h> KAMALIKA PIERIS <p> This series titled BUDDHIST VIHARAS AND EELAM ends with a discussion on the Hindu Ramayana viharas " sprouting in Sri Lanka . The Ramayana is one of the two great epics of India , the other being the Mahabharata . Ramayana is a part of the Hindu mythology of India and is an important part of the Hindu canon . The two best known versions of the Ramayana are the Valmiki version and the Ramacharitamanas by Tulsidas . There may have been earlier Ramayanas before the one written by Valmiki , said Romila Thapar . <p> Critics say that Valmiki 's Ramayana is a literary epic and has no historical value . It is a poem and not a historical document . Historian H.D. Sankalia dates the work to the 4 century BC . Romila Thapar dates it to 8th century BC . A.L . Basham says Rama may have been a minor chief who lived in the 8th or the 7th century BC . T. Paramecia Ayer said that Ravana was a Gond chief . The Dhur-Gonds are known as Ravana-Vamshis in Central India . <p> In the Ramayana story , Rama is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the king of Lanka . He is portrayed as a powerful demon king . Vishnu incarnates as the human Rama to defeat him . <p> According to the Ramayana , Rama was the son and heir of King Dasaratha of Kosala . He married Sita and together with his brother Lakshmana went to live in the Dandaka forests in exile . At Dandaka he killed several demons that were harassing the villagers . This angered the demon king , Ravana , who , in retaliation , captured Sita and took her to his kingdom in Lanka , in his aerial car . <p> The monkey king Hanuman discovered her there . Having received Hanuman 's report on Sita , Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea . There they are joined by Ravana 's brother Vibhishana . The monkeys named " Naal " and " Neel " constructs a floating bridge ( known as Rama Setu ) across the ocean , and the princes and their army cross over to Lanka . A lengthy battle ensues and Rama kills Ravana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the expiration of his term of exile , Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita and Lakshmana . <p> Historian Romila Thapar said that the Ramayana by Valmiki was not a sacred book . It was a narrative cast in epic style . It contains the usual heroics , kidnapping , rescue , battles , flying monkeys , demons and an aerial chariot . Unlike the Vedas which are confined to Brahmin priests and are meticulously memorized , the Valmiki Ramayana was recited the way it was freely remembered , at rituals , feasts and the Raja 's court . <p> There are many versions of the Ramayana . Oral epics tend to have multiple versions . The Ramayana in North India differs from that found in South India and the rest of South-East Asia , said Thapar . There were regional versions in Tamil , Telegu , Kannada , Bengali , and Marathi . The Tamil poem draws on the Bhakthi tradition . <p> The Ramayana story is contained in the Dasaratha Jataka of the Buddhist literature . There were also a series of Jain versions . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in variant versions . The multiple versions of the Ramayana are more interesting historically , said Thapar . There were plays and poems also written on this story . <p> The Hindu religion and the Ramayana were exported to South East Asia . Hinduism did not take root , but the Ramayana did . There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on the Ramayana in Indonesia , Cambodia , Thailand , Malaysia and Laos . <p> The Cambodian version of Ramayana , the Reamker , holds an important position in Khmer literature . Its Hindu concepts are adapted to Buddhist themes . The Reamker has several differences from the original Ramayana , including scenes not included in the original and emphasis on Hanuman . Reamker , has influenced the Thai and Lao versions . Reamker is seen in all Cambodian art forms , sculpture , Khmer classical dance , theatre , poetry and the mural and bas reliefs seen at the Silver Pagoda and Angkor Wat . <p> Thailand 's popular national epic Ramakien is derived from the Hindu epic . In Ramakien , Sita is the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , So Ravana has her thrown into water to drown , but she is rescued . It has an expanded role for Hanuman and he is portrayed as a lascivious character . While the main story is identical to that of the Ramayana , many other aspects were given a Thai look , such as the clothes , weapons , topography . Ramakien can be seen in elaborate illustration at the Wat Phra Kaew temple in Bangkok . Analysts also observe that all the Thai kings are named Rama . <p> Indian Law courts are careful where the Ramayana gods are concerned , said the media . In India temples are owned by the gods , not the trustees . In 2007 , Indian Supreme Court summoned the two Hindu gods , Ram and Hanuman to appear in court in order to settle a land dispute in eastern state of Jharkhand . The temple priest said the land belonged to him , given to his ancestors by the king . The locals said it belonged to the two deities . Dispute had been going on for 20 years . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is contesting this , reported the media . <p> IN 2007 , the Indian government decided to cut through the Adams Bridge which exists between Tamilnadu and Sri Lanka to create an 83-km-long deepwater channel that will link Mannar with Palk Strait . <p> This Sethusamundran project " called for extensive dredging and removal of the limestone shoals that constitute the Ram Sethu . Ram Sethu , also known as Adam 's Bridge , is a continuous stretch of limestone shoals that runs from Pamban Island near Rameshwaram in South India to Mannar Island off the northern coast of Sri Lanka . Geological evidence suggests that in the Ice Age , the stretch used to be a land connection between India and Sri Lanka , explained the media . <p> In response to the Indian government decision , the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) filed a petition in court against Sethusamudran . The petition said Hindus objected to the Sethusamudran project on the grounds that it will damage the Ram Sethu Bridge which is mentioned in the Ramayana . This bridge is sacred and should not be destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The media announced , The Sethusamudran canal has brought the Ramayana to the attention of the Supreme Court of India . " Court took note of the objection and called for a response from the Government .

@@110027237 <h> KAMALIKA PIERIS <p> The location of Valmiki 's ' Lanka ' had been keenly discussed by Indian scholars . Indian academics can not agree on the location of the ' Lanka ' in the Ramayana . Romila Thapar says the matter has been disputed by Indian scholars for centuries and Lanka remains unidentified . The term Lanka is some Indian languages means island and Sagara means a lake , not an ocean . <p> Writers have pointed out that the Lanka mentioned in the Ramayana is not Sri Lanka . To start with , Sri Lanka was not known as Lanka in ancient times . It was known as Simhala . Mishra points out that all the Indian chronicles , such as the Puranas , and the writings of Varamihira , all stated that the Simhala Island differed from the island of Lanka . ' <p> Mahabaratha refers to two distinct islands called Lanka and Simhala . The Virhatsamhita of Varamihira recorded Lanka and Sinhala as two different places . Rajasekera in his play Balaramayana also showed that Simhala was not Lanka . In this play , Ravana addresses a king who comes from Simhala " . Ravana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Ravana , had been the king of Simhala . <p> T. Paramasiva Iyer in his 1940 book Ramayana and Lanka said that Ravana 's Lanka , if there ever was one , was located in Madhya Pradesh near Jabalpur . It is very likely that Ravana 's Lanka , under the name of Trikuta , was the capital of today 's Kalachari Haihayas , known as Trikutakas till 900 AD . It is quite probable that in the olden days , the Hiran river , which hugs the Indrana Hill on three sides , spread out as a shallow lake all round the hill . <p> Archaeologist H.D. Sankalia ( 1971 ) said that Chotanagpur ( Jharkhand State , India ) was the Lanka of Ramayana . He said that the present day Sri Lanka " can not be the Ramayana Lanka . Sri Lanka was known to Indians of the olden days as Simhala or Tamraparni , and not as Lanka . According to Sankalia Lanka is a Mundari word which means an ' island ' and people of Sonpur on the Madhya Pradesh-Andhra-Orissa border traditionally regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The name Lanka came into use only a thousand years ago . Adams Bridge and Rameshwaram are not the Setu and Shiva temple of Rama 's era etiher . <p> Hiralal Shukla 's book ' Lanka ki khoj ' ( 1977 ) provides information on the places identified . Lanka had been located in various places in India , in Assam , in Rekanpalli , ( between the Godavari and Krishna rivers ) , near Maheshwar on the Narmada river near Jabalpur , in Chota Nagpur in the Mahanadi delta , in the Vindhya mountains at Amarakantaka , near Pendra , ( Bilaspur district , Madhya Pradesh ) and in the Godavari delta . Outside India , Lanka has been located in Lakshadweep , Maldives , Sri Lanka , Sumatra , Australia ( via the Sunda Islands ) and the Lingga Island on the equator . <p> R.L. Gupta ( 1982 ) says Lanka was an island in Narmada lake , now Bagra hill . The Ramayana says that Lanka was located on Trikuti Parvata , close toDhawlagiri surrounded by the hundred yojana sea and in an area where Saltrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , district Hoshangabad , MadhyaPradesh was known as Dhawlagiri earlier . Gupta had also looked at the time Lord Rama took to travel between the places he visited . <p> D.P. Mishra ( 1985 ) says that the evidence points to the triangular delta of the mouth of the river Godavari in Andhra Pradesh . The Godavari has a stretch of alluvial islands , called the Trikuta islands . These are known as the Lankas even today . However , the first meridian of Hindu astronomers is taken to have passed through Ujjain and Lanka . Ujjain is in Madhya Pradesh close to the west coast of India . <p> Critics also say that Adams bridge near Sri Lanka , can not be Ram setu since Rama 's bridge is either eleven and a half miles or 450 miles , runs north- south and ends at a hill . Adams bridge is 30 miles , runs east-west and does not end in a hill .. <p> T. Paramasiva Iyer , observed that In the Ramayana , Lanka was surrounded by sea , Rama built a bridge which was 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of Mahendragiri in the north to Suvelagiri ( a hill adjoining Trikuta ) on whose slopes Rama marshalled his vanara hosts . <p> According to Iyer 's calculations , 100 yojanas would either mean eleven and a half miles or 450 miles . The existing bridge is neither . Moreover , there is no hill in Rameshwaram or anywhere near Mandapam . There is no hill in Mannar Island and none in the northern halfof Sri Lanka.Therefore , it is obvious that Sri Lanka has nothing to do with Ravana 's Lanka . Further , If Ravana was dragging Sita , Lanka could not have been as far away as Sri Lanka . It has to be nearby . If at all , the Ram Setu of the Ramayana was more likely located in a small stretch of water in Central India and not in the Palk Strait . <p> For India 's geography to match the Ramayana , particularly the ' hundred yojana sea ' , the Ramayana era must have been in the period when there was such a lake near the Vindhya mountains . Fossil finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Narmada valley . The lake has black basalt . Mahendra Parvata was north of the Bagra hill and almost at the edge of the Narmada lake .

Emerging from a severe economic crisis , the nation must undertake significant structural reforms to ensure sustainable economic growth . It is absolutely necessary to implement changes and reforming state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , maintaining commitments to international financial agreements , and ensuring debt sustainability . <p> The shocks of the economic crisis two years ago should remain a stark reminder for any future leader or government not to tinker with the economy anymore and continue on the path of reforms . The adoption of the Economic Transformation Bill and the Public Financial Management Bill in Parliament last week point in that direction . There should be policy continuity for the country to achieve economic development and growth and also to attract foreign investments . <p> To set Sri Lanka on a path to sustainable growth , it is essential to implement comprehensive structural reforms . These reforms should address inefficiencies in public sector management , promote fiscal discipline , and enhance the overall business environment . <p> Reforming State-Owned Enterprises ( SOEs ) <p> SOEs have long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inefficiencies , political interference , and financial losses . Reforming these entities is crucial for reducing the fiscal deficit and enhancing economic efficiency . Historically , SOEs in Sri Lanka have been plagued by a multitude of issues . Operational inefficiencies , such as outdated technologies and overstaffing , have been common , leading to significant financial losses . Many of these enterprises have become dependent on government subsidies for survival . Compounding these problems are governance issues characterised by political interference and a lack of accountability . High levels of debt have further exacerbated the situation , putting additional strain on the national economy . <p> The government 's restructuring agenda is driven by several key objectives . Foremost among these is improving efficiency within SOEs by streamlining operations and reducing waste . Achieving financial stability is another crucial goal , with efforts focused on minimising losses and fostering a sustainable financial model . Enhancing governance through increased transparency and managerial autonomy is also a priority , as is reducing the fiscal burden on the government by cutting down on subsidies and public debt . Additionally , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conducive environment for public-private partnerships ( PPPs ) and other collaborative ventures . <p> Privatisation and restructuring of SOEs can bring several benefits , including improved management , increased efficiency , and reduced fiscal burdens . For instance , the successful privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom demonstrated how privatization can lead to better performance and innovation . Similarly , the privatisation of Kenya Airways in the 1990s transformed the airline from a loss-making entity into a profitable one , showcasing the potential benefits of such reforms . <p> However , privatisation is not a one-size-fits-all solution . A thorough study should be conducted to assess the benefits and risks of privatising each SOE . Some entities , especially those providing essential services , may be better served by restructuring rather than privatisation . For example , Malaysia 's approach to reforming its SOEs involved a mix of privatisation and restructuring , leading to improved efficiency and financial performance . <p> Sri Lanka has already taken significant steps towards SOE reform . The adoption of cost-recovery pricing in the energy sector has resulted in these entities maintaining a clear balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address the legacy debt of major SOEs and restrict their borrowings to commercially viable activities . <p> SriLankan Airlines , a significant SOE , has been a considerable financial burden on the state , accruing substantial losses over the years . The airline 's debt reached over USD 1 billion , severely impacting the national budget . The restructuring of SriLankan Airlines is critical . Options include seeking strategic partnerships or outright privatisation , as demonstrated by Malaysia Airlines , which turned around its fortunes through restructuring and strategic partnerships after facing similar financial difficulties . <p> The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC ) , burdened with operational inefficiencies and debt , is focusing on improving operational efficiency and exploring PPPs . Meanwhile , the Ceylon Electricity Board ( CEB ) , a critical utility provider , is undergoing modernization of its infrastructure and service delivery improvements . <p> Enhancing Fiscal Discipline <p> Fiscal reforms are vital for achieving economic stability .

Government revenue is forecasted to increase from 8.2% of GDP in 2022 to 15.0% by 2025 . This increase has been enabled by a broad-based rise in revenue from direct and indirect taxes , despite the significant hardships it imposed on individuals and businesses . <p> Sri Lanka can look to countries like Singapore and South Korea for inspiration . Both countries implemented comprehensive reforms to improve their business environments , attract FDI , and boost exports , leading to rapid economic growth and development . <p> Commitment to International Agreements <p> Maintaining commitments to international financial agreements , particularly with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , is critical for sustaining economic recovery .

The IMF highlighted the importance of sustaining the reform momentum and addressing governance weaknesses to ensure lasting recovery and stable , inclusive growth . <p> Achieving Debt Sustainability <p> Debt sustainability remains a significant challenge for Sri Lanka . The government must continue its efforts to restructure debt with bilateral and commercial creditors to achieve a sustainable debt profile . Finalising agreements with key creditors , such as the Export-Import Bank of China , is crucial for this process . <p> In 2023 , Sri Lanka 's debt-to-GDP ratio was 108% , a stark reminder of the urgent need for debt restructuring . <p> The government 's proactive approach in engaging with creditors and implementing necessary fiscal and monetary policies will be instrumental in achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sustainable debt management practices will help prevent a recurrence of past economic crises . <p> Countries like Argentina and Greece provide valuable lessons on the importance of achieving debt sustainability .

This comprehensive approach , if executed with diligence and commitment , will set Sri Lanka on a path to sustained economic recovery and growth .

Parliamentary polls are expected in May , 2024 . <p> On January 26 , 2023 , Frontline magazine speculated about the reasons for the indefinite postponement of the census : Firstly , the BJP government at the Centre might have wanted to wriggle out of enumerating the population sizes of the Other Backward Classes ( OBCs ) , a politically sensitive and crucial constituency , until the general elections were over . <p> Secondly , the findings of the census might not confirm the " hysteria about growth rates of certain religious groups .

The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive database of " usual residents " in any given area . No document will be required to back any statement . <p> Data thus collected are used to target the government 's economic and welfare schemes , Indian Home Minister Amit Shah told an ANI podcast . <p> However , the NPR became controversial because it was going to be done in conjunction with the more controversial National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) country-wide . Many also asked why there should be an NPR when the census is going to be taken . <p> Shah said that the NPR and the census are two different things . The census encompasses a whole lot of parameters while the NPR is a simple exercise to help the better targeting of government schemes . Government also clarified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document . Documents are a bugbear for many poor or rural Indians who do not have any of them , not even birth certificates . <p> National Register of Citizens <p> The National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) was introduced after the 1951 Census of India to assess the number of immigrants in Assam from East Pakistan following the partition of India in 1947 . <p> But given the unchecked immigration from East Pakistan ( and later from Bangladesh ) , the cut-off date for recognition of Indian citizenship was fixed as March 24 , 1971 . This cut-off point was fixed in 1985 as part of the Assam Accord , following a prolonged and violent agitation by indigenous Assamese . <p> As per the Accord , a foreigner would be given full Indian citizenship including the right to vote if he/she had come to Assam between 1951 and 1961 . Foreigners who had migrated to Assam between 1961 and 1971 would be given all the rights of citizenship except the right to vote , which would be denied for a period of ten years . Those who entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But despite the Assam Accord , massive infiltration from Bangladesh was alleged . In 2013 , the Supreme Court ordered an updated NRC to be done by 2017 . The new NRC required the submission of various documents . But as stated earlier , many did not possess such documents . Thus , more than 1.9 million of the 30 million applicants for inclusion in the NRC in Assam were left out . <p> Those who were left out could , of course , appeal to Tribunals . But the confirmed cases of illegal immigration were to be detained in special camps , and eventually deported . But though detention camps were built , the suspected persons were allowed to stay at home . According to Home Minister Shah , no one has been deported to date . But deportation hangs like the sword of Damocles over their heads . <p> Citizenship Amendment Act <p> The Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019 ( CAA ) is meant to fast-track applications for Indian citizenship from Hindus , Sikhs , Jains , Parsis and Christians who had sought refuge in India due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the CAA , those who entered India after December 31 , 2014 would be deemed illegal immigrants , detained and deported . <p> Though the CAA was enacted in December 2019 , its rules were notified only on March 11 , 2024 . It was not notified in 2019-20 because of a prolonged agitation by Muslims ( especially Muslim women ) and liberals from all communities . It was widely covered by the international media . <p> Now , with the BJP riding a wave of popularity , the government feels encouraged to implement the CAA . But opposition parties and Chief Ministers of non-BJP-ruled States have opposed the CAA and declared that they will not implement it in their domains . The opposition parties feel that the CAA caters only to the BJP 's Hindu nationalist agenda and that its main aim is to garner the votes of the Hindu majority and select minority communities other than Muslims . <p> Unrest in Assam <p> Assam has already taken the cudgels against the CAA . The Act has rekindled the Assamese sub-national sentiment , which in the 1970s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that under the CAA , the cut-off date was December 31 , 2014 while in the Assam Accord of 1985 , the cut-off date was March 24 , 1971 . The Assamese fear that the new cut-off date will open the floodgates to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh . <p> The population of Hindus had dwindled sharply in Bangladesh before Sheikh Hasina came to power as Prime Minister in 2009 . The country 's military dictators in collusion with Islamic radicals used to drive the Hindus out routinely . But Sheikh Hasina put an end to all that . There has been no migration to India under her watch though Indian politicians routinely allege that the number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants is two million . <p> However , there is reason to fear that Sheikh Hasina 's exit from power could lead to the Hindus being forced to flee to Assam again . <p> As feelings are running high in Assam , the BJP Chief Minister of the State , Himanta Biswa Sarma , asked the agitators to appeal to the Supreme Court to shoot the CAA down . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Muslims , Indian Home Minister Amit Shah explained that the CAA is not designed to take away Indian citizenship from any community , but to facilitate the grant of citizenship to specific persecuted communities from specified Islamic countries . <p> But he has not answered the charge that religion can not be a criterion for granting citizenship under the Indian constitution . It is this aspect of the CAA that has been challenged in the Supreme Court by 250 petitions . The latest petition on it , submitted by the Indian Union Muslim League , sought a stay of the CAA notification saying that it was announced even as the issue was pending in the Supreme Court .

Many dictators in the world got killed like Mussolini . Some committed suicide like Hitler . Some escaped execution but only to be denounced , vilified and thrown into the dustbin of history , like Stalin . <p> Generally speaking , the longer a dictator stays in power , the greater the likelihood of his being thrown out , disgraced and even killed brutally . According to British politician Enoch Powell something of this sort could happen to even politicians even if they are not dictators . British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore quotes Powell as saying : ' All political lives , unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture , end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a leader stays in power , the greater the chances of his making mistakes and becoming unpopular . <p> Hallmarks of Dictatorship <p> Dictators typically exhibit three tendencies : ( 1 ) to think that they need more time to realise the objectives they wanted to achieve when they seized power ; ( 2 ) to adopt any means including the foulest to continue in power ; ( 3 ) to continue to use foul methods , imagining that more rather than less of these will enable them to achieve their goals . But their extremism invariably results in total alienation from the masses they seek to serve , who then develop an unquenchable thirst for revenge . <p> Dictators are aware of such an unpleasant end , and yet , they continue doing what they are doing in the belief that more of the same will give the desired results and that moderation will only spell danger to their position . Winston Churchill described the dilemma of the dictator succinctly : ' Dictators ride on tigers from which they dare not dismount , ' he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .

Edward II , notorious for homosexual relationships , was killed with a red-hot metal rod . Benito Mussolini and his mistress were suspended upside down in a town square for the public to view . It signalled the end of his pretensions to both ' Caesarian heroism and Casanovan machismo , ' says Montefiore . <p> And when Stalin suffered a stroke in 1953 , there were no doctors to attend to him because he had arrested dozens of doctors for ' treason ' . The Soviet dictator lay in his own urine for more than 12 hours before his henchmen dared to call a doctor . <p> Tyranny an art form <p> Tyranny is an art form which dictators excel in , says Montefiore .

For a dictatorship to last long , it has to ensure a degree of economic prosperity and justice . But when these are no long assured , their fall is inevitable . This rings true in the Hasina 's case too . She was popular so long as Bangladesh progressed economically , but when the economy floundered , she got the rap . <p> Dictators ' downfall begins when they start collecting around themselves people who feed them with ' facts ' and ' assessments ' they like to hear , rather than the truth . Thus , they shut themselves from the harsh reality outside and indulge in actions that only increase the wrath of the masses .

@@112682231 <p> The Sri Lanka-Korea Business Council last week hosted a top-level panel discussion under the theme ' Sri Lanka 's future : forecast , scenarios and challenges ' , which delved into pressing topics concerning the country . <p> The discussion and insights shared included economic forecast , business impact , socio-economic vulnerabilities and necessary actions , challenges and consequences , current economic status and impact of policy deviations . <p> Needs for multifaceted approach <p> Sri Lanka stands at a critical juncture as compounding debt , weakened state capacity , and the enduring grip of elite capture threaten to undermine its economic future , warned Advocata Institute Chairman Murtaza Jafferjee . In his analysis , Jafferjee stresses the urgent need for a multifaceted approach -- one that addresses the root causes of the country 's economic woes while implementing sustainable solutions . <p> At the heart of the crisis is the unsustainable growth of Sri Lanka 's debt , exacerbated by soaring interest rates and a depreciating currency . Jafferjee observed that the nation 's debt burden has ballooned because debt growth has consistently outpaced economic growth , creating a vicious cycle that has made it increasingly difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clear sign of fiscal mismanagement , driven by factors like sharp rupee depreciation , excessive government borrowing , and rising interest rates . Jafferjee warned that if these issues are not addressed , Sri Lanka 's debt will continue to spiral out of control , leaving future generations to bear the brunt of this financial crisis . <p> The situation is further compounded by the lack of state capacity . Despite efforts to restructure debt , including controversial moves affecting superannuation funds , the state 's ability to manage its financial obligations remains weak . Jafferjee emphasised the need for significant reforms , noting that Sri Lanka 's inability to outgrow its debt underscores the need for a stronger , more focused state apparatus . <p> Adding to these challenges is the issue of elite capture , where a small group of economic and political elites has historically controlled decision-making , prioritising their interests over the broader population . This concentration of power has stifled growth and exacerbated inequality , making it difficult to implement the necessary reforms to stimulate economic development . " As long as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform will remain out of reach , " Jafferjee warned . <p> Moreover , the stress tests conducted on Sri Lanka 's debt levels under various economic scenarios highlight the fragile nature of the economy . While baseline projections show a potential decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio , Jafferjee cautioned against complacency , noting that external shocks or natural disasters could easily derail any progress . He called for prudent economic management to navigate these challenges and avoid past mistakes . <p> Crisis bonds , issued during times of economic distress , are another burden weighing heavily on Sri Lanka 's finances . These high-interest bonds are draining the national budget and limiting the government 's ability to invest in critical services , underlining the need for more sustainable financing options and a rethinking of how economic crises are managed . <p> The wild swings in real interest rates from 2019 to 2022 reflect broader instability within the economy , making it nearly impossible for businesses and consumers to plan effectively . This environment of uncertainty stifles growth and innovation , highlighting the need for stable economic policies that provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jafferjee noted that the IMF 's projections for GDP growth from 2024 to 2029 offer a glimmer of hope . However , this modest growth of around 3% per year is contingent upon Sri Lanka 's ability to navigate ongoing challenges without major disruptions . Jafferjee called this a fragile optimism that requires disciplined economic management . <p> Sri Lanka 's Central Bank faces the daunting task of maintaining price stability while ensuring the stability of the financial system . This dual mandate is challenging even in the best of times , and more so given the current economic turmoil . The Central Bank 's decisions in the coming years will be critical in determining whether Sri Lanka can achieve the balance needed for sustainable growth . <p> Jafferjee also stressed the importance of maintaining strict prohibition against monetary financing -- essentially printing money to cover government deficits -- as a necessary measure to prevent runaway inflation . While there are exceptions for emergencies , such as natural disasters or severe economic crises , these must be tightly regulated to ensure that temporary measures do not jeopardise long-term economic stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly as a percentage of GDP , is another significant risk that can not be ignored . Jafferjee urged that reducing this burden to below 30% of GDP should be a top priority to safeguard the nation 's economic future , warning that failure to do so could leave the country vulnerable to external shocks and potential crises . <p> Understanding the interconnectedness of GDP , savings , investment , and the current account balance is essential for effective policy making , according to Jafferjee . These relationships are complex , but must be managed carefully to avoid economic pitfalls and ensure that policies are aligned with long-term growth objectives . <p> The mixed performance of various sectors in early 2024 highlights the need for targeted support in areas that are lagging . While some sectors like manufacturing and construction show positive contributions , others are struggling . Jafferjee urged the government to identify these weaknesses and provide necessary support to ensure balanced growth . <p> Reviewing growth trends from 2021 to 2024 , Jafferjee painted a picture of an economy in flux , with some sectors adapting well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shaping economic strategy and ensuring that the country supports sectors with the most potential for future growth . <p> Sri Lanka 's reliance on hydroelectric power makes the nation particularly vulnerable to changes in rainfall patterns , with significant implications for energy production . Jafferjee urged steps to mitigate this vulnerability , perhaps by diversifying energy sources and investing in more resilient infrastructure . <p> As environmental changes increasingly impact critical sectors like agriculture and energy , Jafferjee called for a more integrated approach to planning , incorporating detailed data on regional rainfall trends to avoid being caught unprepared . <p> The Chairman also pointed out that higher labour productivity , technical progress , and economic restructuring are key drivers of growth that Sri Lanka must focus on . He urged the government to prioritise policies that enhance these factors to sustain long-term economic development and remain competitive on the global stage . <p> Sri Lanka 's rapidly ageing population presents one of the most significant challenges to the economy , according to Jafferjee . The increasing number of elderly individuals will place tremendous pressure on healthcare and pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these challenges before they overwhelm the country . <p> Furthermore , the gender gap in labour force participation is a missed opportunity for economic growth . Jafferjee argued that encouraging greater female participation in the workforce is not just a matter of equity but an economic imperative , suggesting that closing this gap could unlock significant potential for growth and innovation . <p> Jafferjee also pointed to lessons from Korea 's trade dynamics as valuable for Sri Lanka . By studying these dynamics , he suggested , the country could better manage its own trade balances and foster stronger economic relationships that would benefit the economy in the long run . <p> The depreciation of currencies in emerging markets , particularly in Turkey , should serve as a warning to Sri Lanka , Jafferjee noted . The parallels to the local situation are clear : economic mismanagement and the loss of investor confidence can lead to severe consequences . He stressed the importance of rebuilding confidence in the Sri Lankan economy . <p> Jafferjee also highlighted the damaging effects of inflation , which at its peak neared 70% . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense pressure on businesses . He emphasised the need to address the root causes of inflation to restore economic stability . <p> The sharp contraction in GDP in 2022 serves as a stark reminder of the severity of Sri Lanka 's economic crisis . Compared to other countries , the nation is facing an unprecedented challenge . Jafferjee called for significant effort and a commitment to comprehensive reform to reverse this trend . <p> Sri Lanka 's structural balance reveals the extent of fiscal mismanagement , Jafferjee warned . Without urgent reforms , these imbalances will continue to undermine the economy , making it critical to confront these issues head-on and implement necessary changes to restore fiscal health . <p> Demographic changes , particularly the shrinking working-age population and growing elderly population , present significant challenges , according to Jafferjee . He urged the government to prepare now by developing policies that address the economic and social impacts of these shifts . <p> The decline in foreign exchange reserves is another clear sign of economic distress , Jafferjee noted . Without sufficient reserves , Sri Lanka risks a currency crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring these reserves must be a top priority . <p> Rising unemployment is a direct result of the economic struggles , and as more people find themselves out of work , the social and economic consequences will only worsen , Jafferjee warned . He called for policies focused on job creation and skills training to address this growing crisis . <p> Finally , Jafferjee proposed a series of policy recommendations aimed at addressing these challenges , including fiscal , monetary , and structural reforms essential for stabilising the economy and paving the way for sustainable growth . He concluded with a call for bold action to secure Sri Lanka 's economic future . <p> Navigating Sri Lanka 's debt sustainability : four scenarios for the future <p> Dr De Mel began by acknowledging the progress made in addressing the country 's debt crisis but stressed that the key question remains : is the current restructuring sustainable ? He outlined four potential scenarios that the nation could face as it moves forward . <p> Scenario 1 : Status quo on targets and implementation <p> The first scenario maintains the current targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing debt sustainability analysis ( DSA ) by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) sets fiscal and governance targets essential for a successful program . However , he pointed out that the government has consistently fallen short of its revenue targets due to poorly formulated policies . For instance , last year 's revenue projections fell short by 13% , a figure that was predictable due to the unrealistic expectations set by the budget . Dr De Mel also emphasised that attempting to achieve these current targets would likely fail to ensure debt sustainability , as they were based on assumptions , such as domestic yields , that have not materialised . <p> Scenario 2 : Status quo on targets , better implementation <p> In the second scenario , while the targets remain unchanged , there is a stronger focus on better implementation . Dr De Mel suggested that well-formulated policies could enable the government to meet its fiscal and governance targets . However , he warned that even with better implementation , Sri Lanka might still struggle with debt sustainability unless domestic yields are significantly reduced . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third scenario proposes not only better implementation but also enhanced economic and fiscal targets . Dr De Mel argued that achieving a 4.5% growth rate , combined with a 20% revenue-to-GDP ratio , and reduced yields could place Sri Lanka on a more sustainable debt path . He cautioned , however , that this approach would still require careful navigation through a ' knife-edge ' pathway to avoid economic shocks . <p> Scenario 4 : Updated debt sustainability plan <p> The final scenario involves updating the current debt sustainability plan . Dr De Mel suggested that Sri Lanka could benefit from a deeper restructuring , potentially revisiting terms with bilateral and multilateral creditors . He noted that the IMF 's current DSA for Sri Lanka has been widely criticised and could be improved to provide a more realistic pathway to debt sustainability . <p> Dr De Mel concluded by emphasising the importance of sound analysis and rational policy making , warning against ' magical thinking ' that ignores the harsh realities of economic management . He called on Sri Lanka 's leaders to adopt a more sensible and sustainable approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion <p> Q:If we were to continue with the status quo , even with improved fiscal management and governance reforms , there would still be a significant social impact , particularly on the women and labour force . While the politicians may unite and implement some reforms , more needs to be done , especially on the labour front . What are your thoughts on this and what would you recommend ? <p> A : Dr. Bandaranaike : The elephant in the room is the labour market dynamics and linked to that is the stagnation of the formal private sector . To meet the future commitments , the economy has to grow with stability but it ca n't go without the workers . We have a labour force participation rate of below 50% , where only one in every three women joins the labour force . It is not worth the women joining , when their salaries ca n't even support their child and elderly care expenses . Over 200,000 to 300,000 leave overseas each year for employment and every business complains of employee shortages but for the last so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force have jobs in the formal private sector companies . So , why is the formal private sector stagnant and does not expand ? I have identified three key reasons . First , archaic regulation , completely outdated labour laws . <p> Second , according to the long overdue wage reports , as an example , the national minimum wage in this country , officially was raised by Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 17,500 a month . Since 2022 , we have something called an official poverty line . The monthly income to just be at the poverty line for a family of four is Rs. 60,000 . So , if a family of four has one earner , that man or woman has to earn Rs. 60,000 a month to be at the poverty line . If you are lucky enough to have two wage earners , the minimum wage should be Rs. 30,000 , just to get to the basic needs . The laws and regulations have to reflect the 21st century , not the dark ages . <p> Then there is the bloated public sector . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour force , in 1,300 institutions . As an example , there are 90 Government institutions supporting agriculture and we know how badly that sector is doing . The Government has to rationalise its workforce . <p> The third factor : The unrealistic low formal private sector wages . Among the listed businesses and in other sectors , the starting salaries for youngsters with degrees and now after raising the wages , it is between Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 40,000 a month . <p> This is the scale after the recent wage increases . In 2022-2023 , the salaries ranged from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000 . Do businesses really expect employees to live in poverty ? It 's no wonder they prefer jobs abroad in greener pastures . Wages have to be linked to productivity and businesses have to watch the bottom line . I accept but they really must pay decent wages to employees . You circumvent outdated laws that no longer serve the current economic landscape . It is better to prioritise revising these laws , making it a win-win situation . I also recommend that professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. De Mel : One of the things that is keeping women from the workforce is actually discriminatory hiring and this is seen in the surveys done by the Census and Statistics Department because it 's more costly to hire a woman than a man . You have to pay four months of maternity leave every time there is a child in the family . Now what is fascinating is , there are 159 countries in the world that do n't make the company pay maternity leave . <p> The ILO convention says , in no event shall we put the burden of maternity leave on the employer because it 's well understood that when you do that , you will incentivise the employer to hire a man rather than a woman for the same job . <p> There are plenty of research studies that show where there 's high discrimination , like in Sri Lanka . The labour force participation can increase by at least 10% for women when the state takes on the cost of maternity benefits . If it 's a small cost , it used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rs. 6 billion . It 's still under Rs. 7 billion . It is peanuts compared to what they spend on other social welfare . <p> But interesting is , this was on a Budget . I think now I see it in the Ceylon Chambers recommendations to the Government . But you know , there are not enough women perhaps in the private sector leadership to ask for something so simple and obvious that most of the world does , which costs so little , which is , by not doing , very violation of an international agreement that we have signed up for over 30 years . Which is that the state pays the maternity leave benefits or you have a general taxation that does that . It is a small amount of money but it fundamentally changes the dynamic with regard to hiring women and increasing opportunity . <p> Second , we did research on the cost of women going to work . What we found is , the care economy , the cost of child and elderly care , cost of outsourcing or the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay at home than go to work and earn what they do . <p> And of course , other countries overcome it in multiple ways . But there is an opportunity here . To build care facilities , this is an entrepreneurship opportunity . If you can build credible care facilities for child and elderly care , there 's a huge business case . If we can get the care economy going in the marketplace and even the state can pay for maternity leave , these are two ways I think , that very , very , very concretely create a huge opportunity to release the ability for women to be more productively engaged . <p> Q:How do you see the banking sector ? Because in the first debt restructuring , it was more towards the superannuation funds . Of course , we are yet to see some of the impacts on the banking sector . If it 's the case , if it 's a scenario of a secondary restructuring , what would be the case of the banking sector ? What reforms can we do in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We were not happy the first time around as well as the banking sector , the opportunity that there was to look at the high interest rated T-bills , T-bonds , etc . Where the bankers were coming from was that it is a primary instrument , as it is a regulatory instrument , where it actually invests in bills and bonds , whether it is rupees or dollars , mainly as a Liquidity Adequacy Requirements ( LAR ) component . Now LAR is not there in the new Banking Act . So , it is more the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ( LCR ) . It is done for that purpose . If we were given a choice , it 's not as if that 's the first instrument that we would want to invest in . <p> To be fair , three years , five years down the road , we never looked at the dollar bond . We never looked at , International Sovereign Bonds , etc. , except when the NRFC and expatriate remittances were picking up . There were very little dollar disbursement opportunities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were n't other instruments that met the LAR requirement that prevailed at that stage . <p> And there was a blessing all around to actually invest in sovereign bonds . But now , if you say that this is at risk and you know , everybody might need to participate in further haircuts , which the first time around , maybe we got away unscaled in terms of a haircut . <p> But there was a Net Present Value ( NPV ) in terms of the rescheduled new bonds that were issued at the longer tenure and at the lower rate . We all had to take a hit on P&amp;L . We need to look at new instruments . The Sri Lanka Banks Association , and CEOs will need to have discussions at an early stage with the Central Bank and others .

Why do you have to do that ? Let 's look at alternative products that actually then make the necessary Net Stable Funding Ratio ( NFSR ) , Stable Funding Requirement ( SFR ) and the LCR requirements for banks .

Why do things that you can not do other than for the pure interest of greed , corruption and wanting to make money everywhere you put your fingers in , right ? So , basically , be as small as possible and only play the role that you 're supposed to play , right ? <p> Diversify away the things that you are not supposed to , which you do n't have the capability and grow the private sector with that ; divest the staff , excess staff that you have into those areas . You can actually encourage the private sector to , you know , absorb some of these . You know , staff , wasteful expenditure . Get rid of the unnecessary tamashas .

But what are we saying ? How did we get in here ? It 's because the country could n't do anything for the last half a century and we are trying to save money back for them to do the same thing . You give them $ 1 and think they will use it for the betterment of the country ? It will go to their pockets again , right ? So , we leave it with the people who can do something for the country .

When you bid out power projects on a competitive basis , the prices have come down 40% . <p> I started engineering . I pivoted to economics . Both are studies of constraint optimisation . If you want to do any kind of projects , if you have scarce resources , if you 're constrained , you have to really be innovative and create how to do more with less . In the case of this wind power tender , which I have spoken about , we are trying to award tenders at 8.2 cents for people who are doing similar projects in India , at 3.36 cents . So , how can geopolitics dictate energy security and affordability ? <p> Q:You mentioned the option of revising the debt sustainability analysis . How practical is it ? And all candidates had said that either they are going to bring some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How practical is it with the political environment ? <p> Dr. De Mel : If there is an agreement on the debt restructuring tomorrow , the official creditors agree with the private creditors , we have to close it . This train has travelled too fast . There is a small risk that we will not get the agreement . The official creditors could really reject the private creditors ' offer . If that happens , you get into another cycle . If you do , do n't see that as a disaster ; see it as an opportunity . If you do n't , accept it and then work to have better targets than the IMF is giving you . If you do n't fix the Government , you ca n't fix it . <p> If we imagine that we are going to fix this thing without fixing the Government and political leadership , and act in a way for the interests of the few rather than the many , it may be quite hard to get there . One might ignore the main constraints or constraint optimisation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce this constraint ? The constraint is too much . We need a far better ability and commitment in the Government . <p> Q : If you have a single advice for the presidential candidates , what would it be ? <p> Alles : Have a policy and implement it strictly . Have a policy that is a statement of intent of anybody who wants to be part of them , about honesty , integrity and a culture of no corruption . <p> A : Dr. Bandaranaike : Look at the labour laws , labour regulations and wage system and see what can be done to make the women join the labour force . <p> Q : The presidential candidates say they all agree on one single thing . What is the one thing they should agree on ? <p> A : Jafferjee : Abolish the executive presidency .

The renegades have no one who generates that type of enthusiasm among their voters . Namal 's vote fractures Ranil 's SLPP-SLFP political prop . <p> Historic political outcomes <p> At no time did the island 's Left do better electorally than at the first General Election in 1947 on the eve of Independence 1948 . There was a slim possibility that a Left government could have taken office , but that would have had to be a Left-led government , which consisted of an alliance between the Left parties and the progressive independents ( among whom was SWRD Bandaranaike ) . <p> The story is well-known . A discussion was held at ' Yamuna ' the residence of Herbert Sri Nissanka . Trotskyist LSSP theoretician Dr Colvin R de Silva denounced the idea of a politically pluralist coalition which would unite the divided left and the independent progressives , as a " three-headed donkey " . That was the end of the best chance ever for a Left-led progressive government . <p> What Colvin R de Silva did in 1947 , Anura Kumara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his party opened the door to dissident elements from the centrist parties who had been knocking , greeted them traditionally ( " Ayubovan " ) , saw their faces , recognised that they had " bad political histories , pedigrees " and shut the door in their faces . <p> DS Senanayake , the UNP leader was able to clinch the outcome and form the first administration at Independence because he , in stark contradistinction to the Left , reached out as widely as possible and formed a broad-based coalition government . <p> This happened not once but twice in post-Independence Ceylon . Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake elected in 1952 , resigned the next year after the Hartal of August 1953 , the first ' Aragalaya ' . The ruling party replaced Senanayake with the first Ranil , UNP tough-guy Sir John Kotelawala , whose advisor was Ranil 's father Esmond . <p> The Hartal was led by the two left parties the LSSP and CP , which did not form a left united front even afterwards . The United Left Front was formed only in 1963 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1956 was won not by the ( divided ) Left which had led the Hartal , but by a moderate-centrist anti-UNP party which had come in third , behind the LSSP , at the previous General Election of 1952 . <p> Why did the Silent Revolution of 1956 pick the centrist SLFP as agency instead of the powerful Left ? Because it was a progressive , center-left coalition ( MEP ) , fusing the socioeconomic and the **27;2455;TOOLONG , rather than a single Marxist left party . <p> Even in crisis , the Buddhist ethos makes Sri Lanka much more inclined to the Middle Path which eschews Right and Left ' extremes ' . <p> Ranil Wickremesinghe , and much more substantively and authentically , Opposition leader and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa , have formed multiparty alliances . It is possible that , just as at Independence in 1948 and again in 1956 , the strategic formula of a broad coalition will prevail over that of sectarian rejectionism by a politically puritanic and exclusionary Left . <p> Had Anura and his party been diligent students of the global left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of " the accumulation of forces " . AKD-NPP have indeed engaged in an " accumulation of forces " , but that is " the accumulation of social forces " -- as did the LSSP in its glory days , the 1940s and ' 50s . They have , however , turned their faces away from " the accumulation of political forces " . <p> AKD-NPP have failed to understand that a network of political partnerships and the very optics of political leaders -- not mere Ministers as in Ranil 's case--in concert , facilitate broader-gauge appeal and longer-range social reach than a one-party political movement is likely to be capable of . As Fidel Castro used to insist , " unity not merely adds , it multiplies ! " <p> The real political turning point in the JVP 's second uprising was the all-parties Roundtable summoned by President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1989 . It was widely attended even by the short-lived political wing of the LTTE represented by Dilip Yogi , but boycotted by the over-confident JVP which thereby isolated itself . 35 years later it has still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaleidoscopic ( to borrow Mervyn de Silva 's term ) , could at critical moments , tilt the balance of forces and thereby the outcome . <p> Politics by blocs <p> Serious politics is fought out between ' blocs ' of political forces -- and international politics by ' alliances ' --which contain diverse elements . These blocs have leading -- ' hegemonic ' --elements and ideologies , but the blocs themselves are heterogenous in social and political composition . These blocs sometimes collude , sometimes contend , but at decisive moments with high stakes , collide . <p> Serious politics is not fought out between homogenous , ' pure ' or ' unitary ' political armies lining up against each other . This was comprehended and communicated with characteristic lucidity by Lenin . <p> " So one army lines up in one place and says , ' We are for socialism ' , and another , somewhere else and says , ' We are for imperialism ' , and that will be a social revolution ! ... Such a ridiculously pedantic view ... Whoever expects a ' pure ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person pays lip-service to revolution without understanding what revolution is . " ( Lenin ' On the Irish Rebellion of 1916 ' https : **39;2484;TOOLONG ... The same goes decisive national elections in a time of crisis . The expectation that all the forces of and for the **26;2525;TOOLONG , will line up together in one place and declare " we are the elite and for the System " , while the others will or should line up against it and declare " we are against the elite and the System " is a " ridiculously pedantic view " of politics in general and contemporary Sri Lankan politics in particular . <p> Synergistic combined teams are best <p> AKD is himself the leader of a bloc , but it is a one-party ( JVP ) bloc with no other real parties . Instead , it has an interlocking directorate with its quasi-autonomous auxiliary Movement , the NPP . <p> There is a stark difference between Ranil 's and Sajith 's alliances . Ranil and his bloc provide a snapshot of the oldest generation in politics ; the old Establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sajith 's bloc appears a galaxy of proven talent , drawn from across the political and ideological spectrum . As Dullas Alahapperuma said at the spectacular Kurunegala kick-off rally , it " politically brought together Right and Left , North and South , East and West " . Together with the SJB 's best , the Alliance leaders would constitute a formidably competent Cabinet to manage the crisis . The collective profile comes across as mature and experienced , but not decrepit and senile ; middle-aged and energetic , but not amateurish or juvenile , and ideologically centrist . <p> Ranil 's is a bad team , Anura 's is a good team , but the best team is one which can produce synergies , and that 's a combined team . USA and Singapore encourage migration to secure the best minds from all over , which gives those countries an edge . So also , in politics . The best can not possibly come from one place . Anura is against political migration . Ranil and Sajith encourage it , but Ranil gets the decrepit and discredited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best team . <p> Anura 's alliance allergy <p> For AKD , political alliances represent arrant opportunism and politically " froggish " behavior . That does n't explain why he has n't drawn in the FSP as ally . For a Marxist , he is strangely oblivious of five basic phenomena/factors . <p> Firstly , an " organic crisis " as Antonio Gramsci defined it . Gramsci describes an ' organic crisis ' as one in which social classes detach themselves from their traditional political parties . That -- and not mere opportunism or corruption-- is what has happened to/within the Pohottuwa , and explains its alignment with Ranil . <p> Secondly , the importance of political economy and class/elite interests . Like the ' labour aristocracy ' , the privileged trade union elite in the West as classified by Lenin , the Ministers of the SLPP and SLFP represent an elite , the interests of which can not be accommodated any longer within the ' Mahinda Chinthanaya ' policy pillars of economic semi-statism and patriotism/nationalism . The SLFP-SLPP barons are materially best served by and thus politically more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all " economics . <p> Thirdly , ' synthesis ' arising from the clash of opposites . While both Ranil and Anura have ideologically homogenous blocs , only Sajith Premadasa has the benefit of fusions ; syntheses . Sajith 's SJS represents the broadest degree of political pluralism and ' unity in diversity ' . This makes Sajith 's supportive Alliance , more accurate a mosaic or mirror of the country and society . <p> Fourthly , Anura does n't understand the different types of change and different types of times in history , from the long duration--'la longue dur ? e ' -- to the ' current moment ' . Anura currently recognises only two types of change : <p> ( a ) The Aragalaya ( 2022 ) rejected the System , the post-1948 Establishment . <p> ( b ) The post-1948 Establishment is now uniting against the NPP-JVP . <p> Fifthly , Anura does n't allow for inter-capitalist and intra-capitalist contradictions , i.e. contradictions between capitalist forces and within capitalist entities . Current changes do not show various formations uniting against the JVP . If everyone or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a solid alliance along the lines that Ranil Wickremesinghe wanted , running from the Pohottuwa to the SJB . Instead , there are three non-JVP/NPP adversarial forces --Ranil 's , Sajith 's and Namal's-- for whom anti-JVPism is secondary and subordinated to their primary drive to win the election , or in Namal 's case , to make a big splash now so he could win in 2029 . <p> Instead of uniting , the elite establishment has divided into two distinctly different blocs in bitter contention with each other over political power : <p> Lenin said that " the concrete analysis of a concrete situation " is the heart of Marxism . The central analytical concept in Marxist politics , that of " conjuncture " , is best defined in the Glossary of Louis Althusser 's ' For Marx ' ( my own copy dated August 1973 , London , was a gift from EROS founder Eliyathamby Ratnasabapathy ) as follows : <p> " CONJUNCTURE . The central concept of the Marxist science of politics ( cf. Lenin 's ' current moment ' ) ; it denotes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictions at any given moment to which political tactics must be applied . " <p> ( Louis Althusser , For Marx , Penguin University Books , UK , p 249 ) <p> In the crucial year 1917 , Lenin 's rapid shifts to keep pace with the situation gave rise to his comrades " the Old Bolsheviks " being befuddled . Trotsky , a long-standing critic and rival of Lenin , joined the Bolsheviks and was welcomed by Lenin because there was a conjunctural convergence of their positions after more than a decade . Within months Lenin shifted his slogans from " All Power to the Soviets " to " All Power to the Bolsheviks " . Furthermore , by his own admission , his Bolshevik party abandoned its Agrarian program of collectivisation , and instead adopted ( i.e. , purloined ) the Agrarian program of land distribution of its rival , the Socialist Revolutionaries ( " S-R " s ) . <p> As Lenin is recorded as having remarked in a caf ? conversation in Europe " nothing is more radical than reality " . <p> I am gratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Why the JVP-NPP 's moderate leftist ' pink paradigm ' deserves a chance ' was widely recycled last week . That could partially be intended as a reminder which serves to counter a reset in my position . If my current position has shifted -- I still think Sajith and Anura are our two best choices , but in that order-- it is because the ' concrete situation ' , the ' conjuncture ' , has substantively changed . <p> I draw readers ' attention to some points I made in March this year : <p> " ... ( VII ) Their main rival the SJB had the exclusive franchise on the richly relevant , populist-tinged Premadasa development doctrine but traded it in to become a version of Rishi Sunak 's UK Conservatives . AKD has faced-down his ideological hawks , Sajith has n't . He has empowered them or been coopted by them . As things currently stand , Sajith notwithstanding , an SJB government will be bad : Eran-Harsha , ideological fundamentalist twins who dominate discourse and veto party policy , are the SJB 's Cheney-Rumsfeld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reap its deserved and nationally necessary victory . Why ? <p> ( 1 ) It is unlikely that the JVP-NPP by itself can swing the decisive uncommitted voters , and no automatic process of polarisation is guaranteed to deliver those voters to the NPP . The unwillingness to incorporate into an equation , political figures like Prof. Charitha Herath with the requisite appeal to move the middle-ground , could prove counterproductive and costly . " <p> ( B ) Sajith and the SJB have constructed a broad and diverse political coalition which includes key elements of the center-left , thereby constructing a progressive-centrist alternative . <p> ( C ) AKD has scornfully rejected potential political partners from the dissenting center-left . <p> Thus , the concrete situation , the ' conjuncture ' , the ' current moment ' , has reconfigured . <p> Swerve and encounter <p> Young Karl Marx 's doctoral thesis was on the ancient Greek philosophers Democritus and Epicurus , and encompassed the ancient Roman philosopher-poet Lucretius . They were the Atomists . <p> Their key postulates were : <p> The ceaseless rain of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . <p> Their ' encounter ' which caused the appearance and movement of things ; <p> The unpredictable ' swerve ' of the atoms which enabled the ' encounter ' . <p> The final contribution of the French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser , ' Philosophy of the Encounter : Later Writings 1978-1987 ' posited the doctrine of ' Aleatory Materialism ' -- the materialism of ' The Encounter ' -- arguing for the incorporation of the insights of Epicurus and the ancient Atomists into Marxist ' historical materialism ' . <p> Extending his earlier tributes to Machiavelli who embarked on the impossible project of a unified Italian state through an ' encounter ' of ' Virtu ' and ' Fortuna ' , operating on the unpropitious terrain of warring princely states , Althusser argued that Marxist political strategy should : <p> Aim at and exercise efforts to cause an ' encounter ' through generating a ' swerve ' of the ' atoms ' of the politico-historical process . <p> Move to take positions from which a ' swerve ' could be caused , and at which the ' encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Lanka Guardian 40 years ago , was denounced in Trotskyist publications for ' social democracy ' , and worked with President Premadasa 35 years ago , I 've strived for a ' swerve ' that would cause the ' encounter ' between leader-alliance-Social Democracy-State.

To cater to the urgent order , Thales has postponed production of the new ePassports till January next year . <p> Epic Lanka dominated passport supply for 23 years without tender after winning the first order .

This two-key encryption allows the Sri Lankan passport 's PKI to be lodged with the International Civil Aviation Organisation 's public key directory ( PKD ) for access by immigration entities worldwide .

But Helakuru and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene both in terms of respondent numbers and in terms of traction . <p> Helakuru is a popular Sinhala-language application headed by founder and CEO Dhanika Perera . It predicts an 80% victory for Anura Kumara Dissanayake . The Institute for Health Policy ( IHP ) , a research organisation headed by Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya in July , had predicted a 37% victory for Dissanayake , closely followed by Sajith Premadasa at 36% . <p> But critics have pointed to sample biases and an inability to account for last-minute political shifts as reasons to dismiss the results . Helakuru relies on a large sample , which last week had over 30,000 respondents . Their respondents are almost entirely Sinhalese , and because they rely on users of their app to fill out the survey , the data skews towards young people who can afford smartphones and internet . <p> IHP relies on a combination of data from existing participants of their health surveys as well as random dialling of telephone numbers . They use data from nearly 20,000 interviews conducted since 2021 , of which 701 were conducted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dissanayake . The data is analysed using a Multilevel Regression with Poststratification ( MRP ) model to correct differences in their sample populations over the long period of time when data was collected . MRP has been successfully used to get results at a localised level from large national samples , but IHP has adapted the method to narrow by time rather than region , raising questions . <p> Despite some scepticism , the predictions have gained traction . IHP 's poll in particular has been broadly considered reputable and has been reported in Ada Derana , Mawbima , Thinakural , and several other popular news sources . <p> The Election Commission ( EC ) is not pleased with the trend . Election Commissioner General Saman Shri Rathnayake questioned the agendas behind the " corrupt " and " illegal " practice and claimed that the Presidential Elections Act indirectly prohibits such activity . He worries about the sample bias in the polls deceiving people and fears that they will sway voters .

" Elections are not a product to be given to the market for research , " Mr. Rathnayake said , adding , " These polls are an artificial intervention . " <p> However , Dr. Rannan-Eliya and Mr. Perera disagree . Dr. Rannan-Eliya says that there is no consistent evidence to show that polls sway election results and that in reality , polls , especially those that ask about voting priorities like the IHP polls , provide a valuable service . " By indicating a close election , we are providing a service to the Election Commission too , " said Dr. Rannan Eliya . " They should be focussing on educating people about preferential voting because not many people know how to do it , and second preference votes are going to matter in this election . " <p> He also argues that polls are a way of showing politicians " what people really want " and ensuring they align with the public 's interest . This sentiment is shared by Mr. Perera , who plans to use Helakuru 's polling platform to collect citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed .

Enactment of anti-corruption laws was often a painful process . In July last year , however , Parliament passed without a vote a comprehensive anti-corruption bill that , inter alia , strengthened the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption . The new law , operational from September last year , was connected to the International Monetary Fund 's programme . The $3 billion bailout package was conditioned upon the government introducing anti-corruption legislation to strengthen governance and bring it in line with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption . In its Governance Diagnostic Assessment on Sri Lanka , the IMF insisted on the need for stronger anti-corruption frameworks , including better enforcement of existing laws and the introduction of legislation to combat corruption more effectively . <p> The new Act broadens the definition of corruption to include decisions made with a dishonest motive , causing unfair advantage or loss deliberately .

Noting that revenue collection is higher in less corrupt countries , its 2019 report cited Georgia as a positive example . <p> In Georgia , in 2003 , a new government launched an aggressive campaign to reduce corruption from very high levels .

The Middle East has long been a strategic area for India 's energy needs , and any disruption in the region could have significant implications for India 's economy and its energy security . <p> Given the nation 's reliance on West Asian oil supplies , any volatility in the region 's trade routes could severely impact not only energy imports but also India 's burgeoning trade with Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) countries . <p> Impact on Trade , Navigation , and Supply Chains <p> One of the most pressing issues discussed by the CCS was the potential impact on maritime trade and supply chains , particularly those involving oil and petroleum products . India 's trade is deeply intertwined with the Middle East , and much of it relies on critical maritime routes , such as the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes , which would have a ripple effect on global shipping and commodity prices . <p> The Red Sea and Gulf of Aden , in particular , are strategic maritime zones for global trade . These routes serve as a lifeline for India 's exports and imports , accounting for a substantial share of India 's overall merchandise trade . <p> In FY23 , India 's total merchandise trade amounted to ? 94 lakh crore , with approximately 68% of it transported by sea . The Red Sea route , facilitated by the Suez Canal , alone accounts for half of India 's exports and nearly one-third of its imports . These figures underscore India 's dependence on stable maritime routes for economic sustainability . <p> The CCS expressed concern over the possibility of higher freight tariffs due to increased security risks posed by Iran-backed Houthi rebels , who have historically targeted commercial vessels passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden . <p> Hezbollah militants , with close ties to the Houthis , could further complicate the situation , potentially leading to additional disruptions in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had repercussions : India 's petroleum exports , for instance , dropped by 37.56% in August 2023 due to supply chain challenges arising from regional unrest . <p> Energy Security at Risk <p> The Middle East 's status as a critical energy hub for India adds to the sense of urgency in the government 's response . India imports over 80% of its oil , and a significant portion of this comes from the Gulf region . The ongoing conflict in West Asia poses a serious risk to India 's energy security , particularly as oil prices become more volatile . <p> The Cabinet Committee on Security emphasized that any disruption in the supply of oil and petroleum products could lead to sharp increases in energy costs , which would have a cascading effect on inflation and the broader economy . <p> The Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) countries are crucial trading partners for India , with bilateral trade reaching $162 billion last year .

India has a long-standing policy of maintaining friendly relations with all key players in the Middle East , including both Iran and Israel . <p> As tensions mount , New Delhi 's balanced approach becomes increasingly important in ensuring that the conflict does not spiral into a full-blown regional war . <p> India has consistently advocated for peace and dialogue as a means of resolving conflicts .

As the world 's third-largest importer of crude oil , India is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices caused by geopolitical instability . Higher oil prices would strain India 's fiscal budget , exacerbate inflation , and reduce growth prospects in key sectors such as manufacturing and transportation . <p> Moreover , disruptions in global supply chains , particularly in critical areas like shipping and logistics , would have knock-on effects on a wide range of industries .

The crisis could also spur India to accelerate its efforts to diversify its energy imports , reducing its dependency on oil from West Asia . <p> Renewable energy initiatives , such as solar power , could gain further momentum as India seeks to insulate itself from the volatility of international oil markets . The CCS emphasized the importance of continuing these efforts , ensuring that India 's long-term energy strategy remains resilient to global shocks . <p> Conclusion <p> As the crisis in West Asia continues to escalate , India faces a complex set of challenges that demand swift and strategic responses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravity of the situation and the need for proactive measures to safeguard India 's economic and security interests . <p> While the government remains committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region , the ripple effects of the conflict are already being felt , particularly in trade and energy markets . <p> India 's diplomatic strategy will be key in navigating this crisis , and its calls for dialogue and de-escalation are a reflection of its long-standing policy of non-alignment and peaceful conflict resolution .

But the airline industry has been grappling with post Covid re-adjustments and a stifling regulatory atmosphere . This has resulted in their inability to cater to the increased demand for airline tickets since Covid ended , and people wanted to catch up for lost time . <p> It is expected that a new Trump administration would ease up regulations imposed on the airline industry , accounting for a new dynamic approach to air-travel on the part of airline companies that have been hoping to open up more business opportunities , but have n't had the chance to do so because the burdensome regulatory atmosphere did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a generally more sanguine approach to business everywhere , and in all sectors , which would have a knock-on positive effect on the travel industry as well .

Though the world economy is expected to grow at a modest rate of a little over 3 percent over the course of the next year -- as it did in 2024 -- it is expected that the U.S economy would outperform expectations in 2025 . Many analysts have predicted that .

There is an expectation of world peace with the advent of a new Trump administration , and a boom in the U.S economy as pointed out . All this would mean that there will be more optimism in the business world , which generally has a contagious effect . It is common sense in the world of economics that good vibes generate greater good vibes , accounting for a general uptick in economic growth spurred on by a renewed sense of optimism and can-do spirit . <p> There is more competition also that would be on the cards of course .

@@118419236 <h> Progressing the Flood Response Mechanism in Sri Lanka <p> Presently , a lot of areas in Sri Lanka have been affected by floods with the rainfall from Cyclone Fengal . According to the Disaster Management Centre ( DMC ) , nearly 60,000 families and more than 200,000 people have been affected by floods and landslides in 17 districts across the country . Flood incidents have been reported recurrently every year or on several occasions in the same year in recent history . Experts in the disaster management sector find that natural disasters are increasing all over the world due to climate change . In finding solutions to disaster risks , academia , researchers , and practitioners should mediate scientifically , and the government 's responsibility is to find sustainable solutions to floods , landslides , and other natural and man-made disasters based on scientific findings . <p> The Disaster Management Act , No. 13 of 2005 , provides a framework to manage disasters in Sri Lanka . The Act has given more emphasis to the activities of the pre-disaster management phase .

Cyclone early warnings and tsunami early warnings are issued by the Department of Meteorology ( DM ) . <p> Based on the directives of the above technical agencies , disaster mitigation , preparedness , response , and recovery activities should be planned and implemented at the village , local , district , and provincial levels . Specifically , flood management should be planned based on river basins . In finding sustainable solutions to disasters , the activities at each of the levels mentioned above should be planned and implemented appropriately through government policies and directives . <p> Disaster Management <p> The DMC , as the main coordination body in disaster management in Sri Lanka , has established District Disaster Management Committees , Divisional Disaster Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the practice in the field is that these committees do not operate satisfactorily . Some researchers have found gaps in the performance of the current mechanism . Further , the DMC has prepared the District Disaster Management Plans , Divisional Disaster Management Plans , and , in some areas , Grama Niladari Level Disaster Management Plans . Mostly , these plans are not used even in disaster situations because they are not technically sound enough to cater to disasters . These issues should be addressed by the Government to face future disasters effectively by minimising the damage to society . Even the current Disaster Management Act has not specified the responsibilities of stakeholder agencies in disaster management . The proposed amended Disaster Management Act has been awaited for years and is presently in process . The policy mechanism for disaster management should be updated to specify the responsibilities of stakeholders . <p> According to current practice , during major disaster occasions , District-Level Disaster Management Committees are gathered immediately with the participation of all relevant government agencies and political authorities . The district secretaries call these meetings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the treasury . <p> Wide-scale damage assessments <p> It is very important to conduct damage assessments after every major disaster to evaluate the impact of disasters . In such a survey , the damage to houses , properties , infrastructure , crops , industries , self-employment , livestock , etc. , should be identified . Such a database is crucial to compensating the affected people and to assessing the total cost of the disaster to the economy . Wide-scale damage assessments have not been conducted for disasters in Sri Lanka previously . <p> Such data are important to plan future disaster management activities . In the Disaster Information Management System of Sri Lanka operated by the DMC , only limited data such as the number of affected people , families , and damaged and destroyed houses are included . Still , these data are insufficient to plan disaster management activities . Not only in the field of disaster management but also in other fields , there is a lack of essential data necessary for development planning . The worst-case scenario is that , even though enough graduates are employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper databases essential for development planning have not been developed . <p> Conveniently , response and recovery are only a part of disaster management , while mitigation and preparedness are more important . Even the Sendai Framework for Action , the global-level programme implemented presently by the UN , has emphasised the need for mitigation and preparedness activities . Accordingly , proper land-use plans should be implemented to mitigate disasters such as floods , landslides , droughts , etc . Most flood-vulnerable lands have already been occupied by people , so most floodplains no longer exist in the lower parts of river basins . Inappropriate constructions by people are disrupting the runoff water during rainy seasons , creating floods . Many landslide-prone areas are occupied by people for residence , other constructions , or farmlands . The Government should identify these issues and implement current policies or introduce new policies to resolve these issues and conserve the ecosystem for future generations . <p> The DMC and NBRO have been kept under the Ministry of Defence by the present Government , as was done by previous governments .

A convoy of luxury vehicles and a myriad of security personnel used to accompany politicians in the past , and people remained scared even to look to them for succor . The ministers who served in the previous Cabinets were provided mansion-like bungalows in the heart of Colombo at the cost of taxpayers . Taxpayers ' money was used to refurbish them with modern furniture and carpets .

@@118419239 <h> Dawn of Meritocracy <p> For the first time in the history of Sri Lankan elections , the National People 's Power political party has established a government of meritocracy . It has not only formed the smallest cabinet of 22 ministers , but also a cabinet of ministers that includes educated intellectuals , 5 professors , and 3 doctors . This is truly a commendable feat . In the past , the lament of critics was why the people were electing uneducated and unworthy candidates in elections . The blame was on the people and not the political parties . <p> However , the people had no choice but to vote for the unworthy candidates nominated by the political parties . The recent general elections vindicated that the critics were wrong . The NPP political party boldly , consciously , and by its own volition nominated worthy and educated candidates for the recently held general election for parliament . Thus , the people responded by electing worthy candidates . But this happened by chance , that is , the political party NPP voluntarily nominated educated , worthy candidates for the elections . However , we must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , a system change is necessary to ensure that political parties , by electoral law , are required to nominate candidates with a minimum educational qualification for any election .

This has to be rectified by stipulating a minimum educational qualification of a university degree or an equivalent professional qualification from a recognised institute and with an age limit of not more than 70 years . <p> More system changes are needed in the governance of the country . <p> A system change means a change in the way the country is governed , a breakaway from the traditional and conventional systems , which are defective , inefficient , and wanting in efficacy . Since multiple system changes are required , the framing of a new constitution is a sine qua non to achieve these system changes . <p> ( a ) Executive Presidential System <p> The Executive Presidency has to be abolished and a return to the Westminster form of parliamentary governance is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . The Prime Minister can be vested with the necessary powers of the President but remain an integral part of the Parliament , the legislature . Having a separate Presidential election can be obviated , thus saving the cost of another election . <p> ( b ) A System Change Relating to Political Parties <p> Sri Lanka has a plethora of political parties , though a small island nation . Western countries that are much larger , like the USA and Britain , have two or three political parties . As a result , the political systems in Western countries are robust , stable , and effective . We have around 77 registered political parties , which are ideologically and policy-wise the same , except in mere name . We need a system change to limit political parties .

Therefore , the Constitution should fix a limit to the number of registered political parties or else delist their registration if they fail to obtain a stipulated total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections . By this rule , the multiplication of political parties can be arrested . <p> ( c ) Government Based on Meritocracy <p> The existing electoral law does not stipulate a minimum educational qualification for nomination to contest elections to Parliament or Provincial Councils . Hence , political parties nominate uneducated persons to contest elections . Popular appeal is the main criterion to attract votes of the people . Hence , film stars , sportsmen , and mob orators who appeal to the masses are nominated for elections . It is ironic that while even a humble peon needs to have a minimum education to be appointed to the post , those who are to be elected to the Legislative Assembly , the Parliament , need not have a minimum educational qualification . <p> ( d ) A System Change of Public Service <p> A fundamental overhaul of the public service is a dire necessity to overcome its inefficiency , ineffectiveness , low productivity , and inefficacy . The elected politicians head the public service as ministers , but the actual administration is carried out by the bureaucracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transient as governments come and go , but the administration of the public service is perpetual , a continual process . Since the public service is continuous and separate from political governance , it has to be independent . However , in practice , the independence of the public service is undermined by politicisation by different governments coming to power . Every government employs their political party supporters in the public service . Thus , the public service is not only factionalised but overloaded , carrying passengers . The following system changes are needed : <p> 1 . A system change in recruitment to the public service is necessary . A transparent recruitment process is imperative . <p> 2 . Public servants should be served with written job descriptions , functions , and duties . Attendance and leave procedures are necessary . <p> 3 . The public service should be rid of the notion of job security . This is the main attraction for jobs in government service . <p> 4 . From the above , a system of disciplinary procedures for any misconduct should flow . Security of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The above system changes are necessary for a work-oriented culture that promotes the three Es -- efficiency , effectiveness , and efficacy -- and productivity .

The politicisation of the public service should be eradicated . <p> ( e ) System Change of Provincial Councils <p> The Provincial Councils System of Government was introduced at the end of the separatist civil war by the Indo-Lanka Accord in 1987 . However , this needs a substantial change . The rationale was a solution to the problem of the Tamils of the North-East . However , the solution was generalised instead of being particularised for the North-East Province only . Thus , nine ( 9 ) Provincial Councils were created .

Therefore , the 8 Provincial Councils should be abolished , while retaining one unified North-East Provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Government , and the administration decentralised at District Secretariat levels . This will result in huge cost savings to the country by eliminating the holding of eight Provincial Council elections . Moreover , bribery and corruption that had spread to Provincial Councils and countrywide can be controlled and reduced . <p> ( f ) System Change of State-Owned Enterprises <p> A system change of government-owned enterprises is required . The primary function of a government is to govern the country and not to own and manage economic ventures or businesses . Governing the country itself is a wide , complex , and heavy load . Therefore , the government should not dissipate its energies in managing economic enterprises . According to information in the public domain , there are 527 state-owned enterprises . The government should divest these enterprises by privatising them to local or foreign investment capital or both jointly while retaining a few of strategic importance to the country . Further , most of the state-owned enterprises are loss-making ones and a burden to the country 's economy . There will be resistance against privatization by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lord over them and keep them as avenues to provide employment for their supporters , friends , and relations . <p> ( g ) Other System Changes Needed in Economic and Finance Management <p> 1 . Expenditure should not exceed income . It is an axiomatic fact . The state should not live on borrowed finance . This principle is valid and binding for a country . A country 's expenditure should be within the Gross National Revenue it generates . It has to balance its expenditure and Gross National Revenue . Therefore , a system change in finance and economy is of vital importance . There has to be a disciplined system of fiscal and budgetary management . The budgetary deficit between income and expenditure has to be minimal . One can not control recurrent expenditure , which is fixed . However , one can control the variable capital expenditure . There should be a system for rigorous scrutiny of estimates of expenditures of government departments and institutions . <p> 2 . Financing investment projects with foreign and/or local borrowed loans should be subject to the strictest scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overdose of foreign and local loans attached to the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport projects , etc. , exceeding 100% of the Gross National Revenue of the country by the previous government for fancy projects , involving corrupt deals of commissions earned . It is my view that total external and domestic loans should have a fixed ratio of less than 40% of the Gross National Revenue . <p> 3 . The government should have a visible drive to eradicate bribery and corruption of ministers , members of Parliament , and officials of the bureaucracy , not only currently but also retrospectively , by bringing to book bribery and corruption of past politicians , and recovering the stolen assets amassed by them and held in financial havens in offshore banks . Mere rhetoric of fighting bribery and corruption is an empty slogan unless a system change in this respect is vindicated in real action .
