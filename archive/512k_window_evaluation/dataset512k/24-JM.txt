There has been a tremendous focus on advocacy within several networks , jurisdictions , and the public at the CRC and NRC levels , strengthening ties in the region and within the African Diaspora .

While much has been done by way of advocacy , there is significant room for mobilising stakeholders and getting every Caribbean citizen to take reparatory justice seriously . For example , a developmental agenda geared at repair would sharpen focus on education for development with inclusion of reparatory justice learning outcomes in not only history curricula , but in all disciplines .

@@117195236 <p> KINGSTON , Jamaica -- Government Senator Aubyn Hill last Friday shot down his Opposition counterparts ' suggestion that new legislation brought to the Upper House was prompted by the Stocks and Securities Limited ( SSL ) saga , which has seen the now collapsed investment company embroiled in a $4.7-billion fraud scandal since January 2023 . <p> Responding to the assertions of three Opposition senators during the debate on the Financial Services Commission ( Amendment ) Act ( FSCA ) in the Senate , Hill argued that the promulgation of the law started from 2015 . <p> " It was circulated for discussion in 2017 long before SSL happened . So all the pontifications about this being done as a reaction to SSL is entirely incorrect . We brought this to Parliament the first time in 2023 . Since then things have happened ... making laws take time , " he argued . <p> He said that the promulgation of the FSCA Act will allow Jamaica to have another regulatory tool to enhance financial sector stability and offer a greater level of protection for financial consumers . <p> In his contribution to the debate , Opposition Senator Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gleaned that the Bill was prompted from the experience of SSL , and he was happy this piece of legislation has been brought to the fore because it is very debilitating when you have individuals investing in an institution with the hope that they will get good returns in the future , and then they find out there is no money in the financial institution . <p> " I feel the pain of our legend , our icon Usain Bolt in terms of what has happened to him in his experience with the particular company , and wondered if this piece of legislation was there , in terms of the capacity of the Financial Services Commission ( FSC ) to interact and intervene more swiftly in some of these institutions , what would have happened ?

Maybe if those reports from the FSC sent to the minister was read , maybe if we had listened to the board led by Howard Mitchell , what has happened would not have happened to the consumers of financial services which is what FSC is set up to do -- to protect the consumers of financial services , " said Brown . <p> " We on this side support these belated amendments .

Some loans will be unsecured because the risk is mitigated in another way and some will be secured .
