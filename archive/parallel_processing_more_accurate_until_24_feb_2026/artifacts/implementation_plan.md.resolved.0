# VLLM Installation Correction

The user tried to run a `uv`-specific command using `pip`. We will switch to using `uv` which is already installed and more efficient for managing multiple indices.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] VLLM Installation
We will run the installation command using `uv` instead of `pip`.

#### [EXECUTE] Run Installation
```bash
uv pip install vllm --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/0.15.1/cu130 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130 --index-strategy unsafe-best-match
```
*Note: Using `uv pip install` keeps it compatible with the current virtual environment.*

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `python -c "import vllm; print(vllm.__version__)"` to verify the version is 0.15.1.
- Run `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"` to ensure CUDA is still functional.
