# Pivot to LM Studio Integration

The user has decided to use LM Studio as a local LLM backend instead of vLLM due to Windows/CUDA 13.0 compatibility issues.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] Backend Configuration
We will verify and configure the connection to LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible API.

#### [VERIFY] LM Studio Connectivity
We will check if LM Studio is running and responding on its default local endpoint.

#### [MODIFY] Script Configuration
Ensure that `memory_engine.py` and other relevant scripts are pointing to the LM Studio API (typically `http://localhost:1234/v1`).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run a connectivity check: `curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models`
- Run a simple completion test using the `openai` Python library pointing to the local host.

### Manual Verification
- User ensures LM Studio is running with a loaded model and the local server started.
