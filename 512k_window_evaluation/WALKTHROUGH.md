# 512k Token Session-Window Memory Engine — Full Evaluation Walkthrough

## Overview

This folder documents the complete development, debugging, and evaluation of a **RAG-based persistent memory engine** tested at 512,000 token (2,000,000 character) depth on a local `llama3.2:3b` model.

The core challenge: **can a small local LLM + ChromaDB vector store recall specific facts from a conversation that was buried under 512k tokens of dense news article noise?**

## Final Score

| Run | Score | Ingestion Time | Notes |
|-----|-------|---------------|-------|
| Run 1 (pre-fix) | 3/5 | ~65 minutes | Universal entity extraction, no truncation |
| Run 2 (Phase XI) | 1/5 | ~65 minutes | FACT-only extraction, embedding overflow |
| Run 3 (all fixes) | **4/5** | **134 seconds** | All 16 bugs fixed + noise fast-path |
| Run 4 (Bravo query) | **4/5** | **142 seconds** | Different sessions recalled, Bravo 4/4 |

**Best consistent result: 4/5 with 4 sessions at perfect fact recall.**

## Test Architecture

### Injection Schedule
5 target conversational sessions were buried inside 820 blocks of 2,500-char noise text (≈512,500 tokens total):

| Session | Injection Block | Topic | Facts |
|---------|----------------|-------|-------|
| Alpha | 100 | Project Vanguard (submersible) | 4 facts |
| Bravo | 250 | Redis/INFRA-992 debugging | 4 facts |
| Charlie | 400 | Company retreat | 3 facts |
| Delta | 550 | Sci-fi novel | 3 facts |
| Echo | 700 | Q3 marketing metrics | 4 facts |

### RAG Pipeline Stages
```
User Query
  ↓ Stage 0: Query Expansion (keyword extraction via LLM)
  ↓ Stage 1: Vector Search (top 10 hits from ChromaDB)
  ↓ Stage 2: Agentic Routing (LLM picks the best snippet)
  ↓ Stage 3: Group Exhumation (reassemble all chunks from that group_id)
  ↓ Phase XI-A: Entity Cheat Sheet (prepended to context)
  ↓ Phase XI-B: Paged Context Reading (condense if >4k chars)
  ↓ Final LLM Answer (4096 token context window)
```

## Bugs Found and Fixed (16 total, across 3 audit passes)

### Audit Pass 1 — Critical Crash Bugs
| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | `collection.query()` received unbounded keyword string (Tsitsipas loop) — **embedding overflow** | Truncate `expanded_query` to 500 chars |
| 2 | Stage 2 router received full noise prompt (2500 chars) + full snippets (4000 chars × 3) — **3-minute freeze** | Truncate `user_input[:200]`, each snippet `[:800]` |
| 3 | `classify_memory()` received full combined_text with no cap | Truncate `text[:1500]` |
| 4 | `collection.add()` embedded 4000 chars (exceeded nomic-embed-text safe limit) | Reduce to `[:2000]` |
| 5 | `extract_keywords()` output repeated entity strings | Dedup with `dict.fromkeys()` + cap at 500 |

### Audit Pass 2 — Logic and Code Quality
| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 6 | `import time` and `import json` duplicated | Removed duplicates |
| 7 | `rolling_chat_buffer = rolling_chat_buffer[-6:]` creates new list (race condition) | Changed to `[:] =` slice assignment |
| 8 | `_pre_embed_chunks` metadata missing `entities` field | Added `"entities": ""` |
| 9 | Dead variable `start_expand = time.perf_counter()` (never used) | Removed |
| 10 | `paged_context_read()` received full 2500-char noise prompt as `user_query` | Truncate to `user_input[:500]` |
| 11 | Final token budget mismatch: Stage 3 assembled 8000 chars, but `past_memory[]` cap was 6000 | Reduced `past_memory[:6000]` |

### Audit Pass 3 — Concurrency and Data Quality
| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 12 | `_pre_embed_chunks` triggered for every 2500-char noise block (threshold was 2000) — **doubled DB entries** | Raised threshold to 3000 |
| 13 | `session_chunk_index` incremented inside background `_save()` thread — **race condition on chunk order** | Captured index in main thread before spawning |
| 14 | Grading script dropped short words like "Jax" (3 chars) with `len(w) > 4` filter | Lowered to `len(w) > 2` |
| 15 | No session/buffer reset between evaluation queries — **context bleed between tests** | Added buffer clear + time skip before each query |
| 16 | `time.sleep(0.5)` after target injection insufficient for 2-LLM-call save pipeline | Increased to `time.sleep(3)` |

### Speed Fix
| # | Fix | Impact |
|---|-----|--------|
| A | Replaced `chat_logic()` for noise blocks with direct `noise_ingest()` — skips 5-7 LLM calls | **20× speedup: 65 min → 134 sec** |
| B | Aligned Stage 3 budget (8000 → 6000) with `past_memory` cap | No silent context truncation |
