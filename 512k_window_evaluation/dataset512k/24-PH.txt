Nokia phones were not " broke " until they became outdated by technology . In the corporate world , there are great examples how the saying " If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " brought disaster to an otherwise stable and healthy company . Hence , I have seen companies intentionally place change management as part of their continuing process to " fix things " before it becomes too late . These days , the decision to change course is just as crucial as the decision to do business as usual . Since fixing things require a process , patience and discernment become integral in the journey towards change . <p> When it comes to fixing , the situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace remains elusive given the deeply rooted antagonism between Israel and Palestine .

Fixing things forcibly by direct intervention is a failure as exhibited by the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Viet Cong in Vietnam . Other countries can not just force their might over others in the same way parents can not impose their will on their adult children ! Intervention can only produce changes in entities with supposed autonomy as far as assumptions hold true . <p> In the case of my children , I have surrendered my attempts to intervene on their careers and personal lives .

" Whether diets or exercises , whether discarding old habits and making new ones , it requires intentionality in purpose . To start any change , it starts with awareness . We need to be conscious of what 's our current state and a vision of what we want to be in the future . <p> In our spiritual lives , we should accept the fact that we are broken and need some " fixing , " internally most especially . But fixing is far different from tweaking . In his book , " Finding Jesus , " author Matthew Kelly said that " tweaking is selective and selfish , while transformation is total and selfless .

" ( Psalms 34:18 ) Believers understand what it means to be broken and feel defeated , but they are blessed since God becomes closer to them in the process . Our God is always with us , especially in our times of trial . I know I got closer to Him when my father died this year .

@@105312233 <h> Write-off , tax-off <p> A recent En Banc case provided some light to this question .

Part of the assessed deficiency VAT arose from reduction of receivables that were treated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) as collections . <p> CC / Michal Jarmoluk , File <p> Most companies have an enormous balance of accounts receivable in their financial statements . However , some of the receivables pertain to overdue accounts that could become uncollectible in the succeeding years and could subsequently be written off . The question is , can the reduction of accounts receivable due to write-off lead to deficiency Value-Added Tax ( VAT ) ? <p> A recent En Banc case provided some light to this question . In the said case , the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ( petitioner ) assessed deficiency VAT on a general professional partnership ( respondent ) . Part of the assessed deficiency VAT arose from reduction of receivables that were treated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for deficiency VAT because the reduction of accounts receivable is attributable to write-off of uncollectible accounts and , therefore , does not constitute as receipts subject to VAT . It also presented proof of the write-off . <p> On the other hand , the petitioner argues that assessments are prima facie presumed correct and made in good faith -- and the taxpayer has the duty of proving otherwise . In the absence of proof of any irregularities in the performance of official duties , an assessment will not be disturbed . The petitioner also claims that the write-off did not comply with the mandatory requirements set forth under Revenue Regulations ( RR ) 05-99 , as amended by RR 25-02 . The RR provides the following requisites for bad debts to be allowed as a deduction from gross income : ( 1 ) There must be an existing indebtedness due to the taxpayer that must be valid and legally demandable. ( 2 ) The same must be connected with the taxpayer 's trade , business or practice of profession . ( 3 ) The same must not be sustained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36(B) of the Tax Code of 1997. ( 4 ) The same must be actually charged off the books of accounts of the taxpayer as of the end of the taxable year . And , ( 5 ) The same must be ascertained to be worthless and uncollectible as of the end of the taxable year . <p> Let us now discuss the ruling of the Court on the petitioner 's two main arguments : prima facie correctness of the tax assessment , and noncompliance with the requirements of RR 05-99 , as amended . <p> The Court of Tax Appeals ( CTA ) En Banc ruled that the prima facie correctness of a tax assessment does not apply in an assessment that is arbitrary and capricious . It is important that assessments are based on facts and not mere presumption . In arriving at the assessment for deficiency VAT , the petitioner merely compared the beginning and ending balance of the respondent 's accounts receivable and then presumed that the decrease in the balance was undeclared receipts . The Court further explained that a change in the accounts receivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to VAT . Also , in this case , the respondent was able to explain the decrease in receivables with supporting documents . The respondent presented minutes of the partner 's meeting , journal vouchers , and collection letters , among others . <p> Now , for the petitioner 's second argument that the write-off did not comply with RR 05-99 , as amended , the Court discussed that the requirements in the RR pertain to deductibility for income tax and not on deficiency VAT . Hence , assuming that the write-off did not comply with the requirements of the RR , the same would not result to a deficiency VAT , but to a deficiency income tax as it relates to disallowance of claimed expense from gross income . The Court did not examine in detail whether the write-off of the respondent complied or not with the requisites of the RR , but only provided an illustration . <p> Writing off an accounts receivable is a crucial decision for companies not only in terms of the financial aspect , but also on its impact on tax compliance .

@@105865231 <h> No respite for Sunak as gaffes blunt Tory attacks on Labour <p> Rishi Sunak faces a week of potential economic and political hurdles that will test his grip on the UK 's governing Conservative Party . <p> An ugly row with the family of a murdered teenager and an on-air bet about deporting asylum-seekers summed up another week to forget for Rishi Sunak as time ticks down to a UK election . Within days , he may be adding a recession , higher inflation and the loss of two Parliament seats to the list . <p> The setbacks are coming at a critical time for the prime minister , as officials in the Conservative Party grow more concerned about his struggle to establish a winning election campaign narrative . Trailing the Labour Party in the polls , the Tory plan was to spend the opening weeks of 2024 drumming into voters that the economy is turning the corner and that they should stick with Sunak rather than returning to " square one " with opposition leader Keir Starmer . <p> " Because economic conditions have improved , because the plan is working , you are starting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut taxes , " Sunak said , in an interview with The Times published on Friday . " I do believe those pressures are starting to ease and that hopefully over the course of this year we can continue to make even more progress . " <p> That economic argument may soon hit a bump in the road . Data on Wednesday is predicted to show an uptick in consumer prices that , though not derailing the longer-term downward trend , would serve as a reminder of Britain 's ongoing squeeze on living standards . Then on Thursday , Sunak will learn if Britain fell into a technical recession at the end of last year . Economists see it as a coin toss , but whichever way the numbers fall , they will underscore how Sunak is yet to properly deliver on his core promise to grow the economy . <p> All of which poses an unappealing backdrop to the week 's major political event : Thursday 's by-elections in two Tory-held English districts , Wellingborough and Kingswood . Labour is widely expected to take both , given the headwinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more worried by a strong performance by the right-wing Reform UK party , which would trigger new calls for him to step down or be ousted , people familiar with the matter said . <p> Sunak 's critics on the right of the Conservative Party have flagged the special elections as the next marker in their attempts to remove him before the election , which the prime minister is expected to call in the autumn . Their argument is that Labour 's 20-point poll lead has n't shifted for months , and that Downing Street is wasting time it does n't have to turn things around . <p> Doctors ' strikes this month are another looming flash point , a person involved in the plot against Sunak told Bloomberg . A rumored tax cut in the March budget is unlikely to move the polls , the person said , adding that the government 's achievements this year boil down to a ban on disposable vapes . <p> When asked whether tax cuts would be announced in the spring budget , Sunak told the Times that " none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that : " Other people are . I think they 're over-interpreting . What the chancellor and I have said is that of course our long-term plan is to cut people 's taxes . " <p> Sunak 's advisers wanted him to enter this tricky period on the back of more positive headlines , after Labour responded to repeated Tory attacks by jettisoning the opposition party 's flagship green spending plan . Instead , the prime minister 's missteps made the week more of a score-draw with Labour -- despite Starmer 's U-turn ranking as one of his worst days as party leader . <p> " We 've got a series of self-canceling gaffes , " said Steven Fielding , Emeritus Professor at the University of Nottingham . <p> Sunak 's decision to shake hands on a ? 1,000 ( $1,260 ) bet during a TV interview with presenter Piers Morgan , about whether flights deporting asylum-seekers to Rwanda would take off before the election , triggered widespread criticism from opposition politicians . For right-wing Tories , it was n't the subject of the bet but rather the circumstances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk it back , they explained the premier was taken by surprise . <p> Just days later , a similar error played out in the House of Commons -- with far more dramatic consequences . Sunak often pokes at Starmer 's stance on gender identity as part of a strategy to bring so-called culture wars into the election campaign . Doing so while Esther Ghey , whose transgender daughter Brianna was murdered last year , was in Parliament triggered a political firestorm . <p> " Shameful , " Starmer said , as Sunak faced MPs shouting for an apology . <p> Behind the scenes , disagreements broke out around Sunak that laid bare the limits of his authority . Some senior aides urged him to stick by his comments and not apologize . Others saw it as a lapse of judgment , and one privately described it as the worst gaffe in Prime Minister 's Questions they 'd ever seen . There were recriminations about the quality of work done to prepare Sunak . <p> But it also split the Cabinet . As the debate continued over an apology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own leadership ambitions -- posted on social media without Downing Street 's sign off . Though she supported Sunak 's comment , aides saw it as a deliberate attempt to force his hand over a culture war issue that right-wing Tories are keen on . <p> The next day Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt , whose support base is in the more centrist wing of the Tory party , urged the prime minister to " reflect " on his choice of language -- an intervention that also infuriated Sunak 's aides . <p> The episode has underscored Tory concerns about his political instincts . Even some loyalists said he lacks the ability to react quickly when under pressure , which could cause problems in an election campaign . One aide suggested Downing Street should insulate Sunak from awkward public moments . <p> There 's also frustration that such unforced errors led to a missed opportunity to take advantage of Labour 's own internal strife . <p> " It 's a big opportunity cost for the Tories , " said Robert Ford , professor of politics at the University of Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fallout from Starmer 's decision to scale back its plan to spend an extra ? 28 billion a year on green projects to just ? 4.7 billion . The move , driven by economic conditions and Tory accusations that Labour planned to raise taxes to fund the plan , triggered anger among MPs who want the party to prioritize tackling climate change . <p> Starmer 's chief of staff , Sue Gray , reacted angrily to the weeks of internal leaks that the party was about to ditch the policy , suggesting shadow cabinet aides were behaving like bickering Tories and urging senior advisers to find who was responsible , according to people familiar with the matter . <p> In a sign of the discontent in the shadow cabinet , some privately accused Lucy Powell , an ally of energy spokesman Ed Miliband , of being loose-lipped . She denied the claim . Others suggested fiscal hawks who wanted to scrap the policy leaked it in an attempt to bounce Starmer into reaching a decision sooner . <p> Miliband 's disappointment has been tempered by a belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should the economic outlook improve in office , more money might be found for the green transition , according to a Labour official who spoke on condition of anonymity . Labour need to keep quiet on any big spending plans and preach fiscal restraint to win the election , before deciding exactly what to do in office , they said . <p> Miliband told Channel 4 News on Friday he " absolutely " did not consider resigning over Starmer 's decision . <p> Still , Labour 's internal discomfort left Tories lamenting a missed opportunity . Instead , some Conservatives said Sunak 's criticism that Labour " does n't have a plan " was lost in the furor over the prime minister 's transgender jibe . Worse , according to one official , was that Tory attacks against Labour 's most expensive policy had begun too soon and that by scrapping long before the election , Starmer had nullified the potential threat . <p> Still , according to Fielding at the University of Nottingham , mistakes by both parties are " having no impact whatsoever " on voters ' views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour 's commanding lead in the polls and with time running out before the election , a political stalemate helps Starmer far more than Sunak .

@@105867234 <h> Market forces <p> In the late 20th century and early into the current millennium , the mall may have been considered by most as the modern-day equivalent of the ancient marketplace . <p> Much like the huge edifices where most Filipinos troop to in order to relax on a weekend , early cultures , such as the Greeks and Egyptians , evolved a specific place in their towns and cities that served as centers of commerce -- where goods were bought and sold , and services offered and engaged . <p> In some cultures , the marketplace also served as cultural and educational hubs where ideas were traded and valued in the same way as precious metals and unique practices were developed . In fact , it is within these marketplaces that taxation and early writing were conceived . The Egyptians for example developed hieroglyphics where this unique pictorial form of early writing was used principally as a way to keep track of taxes . In fact , one can say in a way that tax gave birth to writing . <p> Due largely to factors such as COVID-19 restrictions , technology and the extraordinary time that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media , the marketplace has now partially , but not insignificantly , shifted away from the brick-and-mortar stores and has now gone into the virtual world . Because of the accelerated pace of technological development , today 's marketplace is enabled by electronic virtual platforms , secure payment systems and online money handling . <p> This enables the new economy to focus on a market that is increasingly present and , in many cases , totally dependent on social media . By the time you would have read this article , the biggest online selling platforms would have cumulatively made hundreds of millions of dollars in such a short period of time . It is therefore not only understandable but expected that tax authorities will pivot toward making sure that this online economy pays its fair share of the tax burden . <p> In this regard , our government 's response to this is to amend Revenue Regulations ( RR ) No. 2-98 which is an issuance by the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) that has been amended many times in its more or less 25-year existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxpayers to act as withholding agents . <p> The current system of withholding tax is designed so that income taxes can be collected at source by using the payor as its agent to collect and remit the tax . These can either be credited or refunded in the case of the creditable or expanded withholding tax or considered a final tax where no such crediting is available . <p> The amendment to the withholding tax regulations may be found in RR No. 16-2023 which became effective on 11 January 2023 . The amendments , as they relate to the digital economy , impose a withholding tax on gross remittances made by electronic marketplace operators and digital financial services providers to sellers or merchants for goods and services sold or paid through the former 's platform or facility at a rate of one percent and imposed on half of the amount of gross remittances . The withholding tax , however , will not apply if the annual gross remittances to an online seller or merchant for the past taxable year have not exceeded P500,000 or if the cumulative gross remittances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not exceeded P500,000 . <p> The implication of the new rules is that its electronic marketplace operators with a digital platform , as well as digital financial services providers with the online facility , will have the added obligation to withhold and remit the tax due from the sellers to the BIR . Failure to act as a withholding agent and failure to withhold a tax will not only place a taxpayer at risk of being assessed for penalties and interest but may also result in the disallowance of an expense if there is a withholding tax due on the said expense . <p> In addition , it also means that vendors who wish to participate or are currently engaged in the digital economy will now need to comply with requirements imposed by the BIR in terms of registration with the authorities and more importantly , reporting and paying the correct taxes . <p> These regulations should also be read in conjunction with the recently enacted Internet Transactions Act of 2023 ( Republic Act No. 11967 ) that seeks to promote a robust e-commerce environment and can be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-98 that will be an important resource to define the coverage of the tax . <p> In addition , concerns have been raised on whether the requirement to act as withholding agent under the amendments should apply to non-residents who engage in business in the Philippines and whether these non-resident foreign corporations need to register with the BIR for this purpose . <p> While it would appear that the amendments pertain specifically to creditable withholding taxes that apply to domestic and resident foreign entities , it is understandable that with an issuance with far reaching implications , non-resident entities that do business through a digital platform may consider these developments as a red flag and may benefit from more clarity on the matter from a trusted adviser . <p> In the meantime , just like the way taxation gave birth to writing , it is clear that the new digital marketplace will give birth to new tax challenges for both the taxpayers and the tax authorities as the digital economy continues to expand . <p> Manuel P.

" <p> I regularly watch the podcast and other similar offerings on Facebook in order to harvest wisdom , positive instructions and motivational ideas . Our thoughts , attitudes and relationships , like plants in our garden , need to be watered or nourished regularly . <p> In the episode featuring Mr. Pritchett , he posed the question to Lewis Howes : " Which do you think is more important : more positive thinking or less negative thinking ? " Where do you get the most mileage -- more positive thinking or less negative thinking ? <p> Pritchett then shares that most of us think that positive thinking and negative thinking are on one line or the opposite ends of the same scale , where negative thinking is the bad end and positive thinking is the good end . We then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and attitudes from one side to the other . It turns out they are not . They belong to separate or two different scales . <p> I then realized that positive thinking is a different set of attitudes , actions and behavior that are diametrically opposed or totally counter to what negative thinking thrives on . They are exclusive to themselves and if we keep it that way , how we think will simply be dependent on what we choose and not what influences us in our surroundings . <p> Pritchett really drilled down on cutting down the negative thinking : <p> " If you want to get your real knowledge , cut down on the negative thinking because that 's the villain voice . That 's the critic in your head , that 's the demotivator , that 's the discounter , that 's the one that raises the doubt . And you can shut it up !

Two weeks later I started to think I " was old . " Many friends say I am in better shape than I was two years ago , that being vegetarian works wonders for my looks but when I verbalized my age , I opened the door and the " Old Man " sneaked in . I kicked him out this morning ! <p> What demotivation have you believed in recently ? It 's too hot , too far , too expensive or unaffordable ? Did the discounter tell you that your participation is unnecessary , that your plan is not big enough ? Did doubt tell you there 's not enough time , money ? That 's what Pritchett was referring to . He warns that 70 percent of our negative thinking is so embedded in our day-to-day behavior , we 're not aware of it as habitual thinking and he refers to it as the 5 Cs . <p> Before you read the 5 Cs of negative thinking , try putting it in the context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you 'll realize how close to home Pritchett 's views are . <p> The first one is Complaining or griping about things like the hot weather . Complaining once in a while is probably " natural " but have you noticed how Filipinos , especially us in Metro Manila , complain about the heat , the traffic , the pollution , noisy neighbors , parking ? If we were to review generation by generation from the 40 's to today , the graph will probably show a steep rise from the 70 's to today . <p> The next one is Criticizing . We criticize things that do n't work like traffic , blackouts , flight delays , bank transactions . We even criticize personalities on TV or in the news or in politics , fashion and entertainment . Aside from local political realities , one other factor that drives the level of criticism in the Philippines is the influence of Western media and culture where right , entitlement and confrontation have infected Filipinos to behave likewise . " Gaya-gaya . " <p> The next one is Concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about inflation , the news . Even our Lord Jesus Christ specifically warned us against worrying , particularly about things we have no power over . Yes , negative thinking is strong but I personally try to catch myself when " Concern " turns into a worry wart I want to scratch . I immediately start praying about the concern and that brings out the Positive scale . <p> One of the 5Cs that Mr. Pritchett stated as something that does not help is Commiserating or being negatively in agreement with someone . " It does not do anyone any good . " Filipinos call it " pakiki-isa or pakikisama . " By being in agreement about how negative or bad a situation is , we actually highlight or make it worse or multiply its severity . <p> Instead of Commiserating , our response should be : Yes , it sucks , but how can I help ? How can we make it better ? Can we focus on something we can do to have a different outcome ? Or , in the words of a Filipino president I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> The last one is Catastrophizing . When you 're down , you just blow things out of proportion . One thing common to individuals or corporations that consult me for crisis management is they think it 's worse than it is -- always . It always is , if your ass happens to be the center of the bullseye or if you have worked yourself into a panic or believe that you 're doomed . <p> Funny thing is , once we compartmentalize and write it on a white board , 90 percent of the time it never is a real crisis . If you 're the 10 percent , then pray and give me a call . Let 's all pay closer attention to what we lean on . Let 's go to the positive .

It was a treat therefore for the audience , mostly composed of senior high school students from different educational institutions around Ormoc , to be able to ask the person behind the film what she wanted to send as a message to them . <p> In the introduction , I reminded the audience that there is such a theory in the arts about the author being " dead , " meaning that when one wants to understand and interpret a work of art , there is no need to communicate to the person behind the art form . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a song , a painting , a film -- depends on the viewer as well . But even as I talked about this theoretical standpoint , I felt it wise to assure them that this time , with the director being around , we could all say , the author is alive and she is here . <p> Whereupon , we all proceeded to what we were there in Ormoc in the first place -- we were re-introducing the art form called cinema and doing it through an exercise called " how to read a film . " <p> Reading a film means not only viewing a film as entertainment but also seeing it as a source of discourse . With its filmmaker being present , Blue Room became an issue not only about the injustices around us and how a system perpetuates social inequalities ; the film was also about how a woman filmmaker navigates important issues in her society . <p> At the center of this new way of reading films , Ma-an Asuncion Dag ? alan spoke of how it was important for her to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that , there was a need for preparation and research . For the filmmaker , to be able to lay down the facts , one must look for ways to dig them through the many filters and gaps in society . <p> What is a talk-back without the admiration of the fans/cineastes of the actors ? <p> It must be said that , outside of the compelling story ( the screenplay , cowritten by Asuncion-Dag ? alan with Siege Ledesma , has been nominated in many award-giving bodies and winning in some ) , the characters were all fleshed out with such empathy because of the actors : JK Labajo , Elijah Canlas , Harvey Bautista , Keoni Jin , and Nour Hosshmand , the only female in the cast . <p> Emphasized during the open forum was the fact that , of all the characters in the story , Rocky was the one who made sense , was rational and unwavering . She was also a woman . As was the film director , Ma-An Asuncion-Dagnalan , who came across as no-nonsense and brave . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the questions thrown were hiding many anxieties , such as : are the youth ready for this kind of tough cinema ? Are we ready to act on the ills of societies ? <p> The film Blue Room was produced by Ma-Ann Asuncion Dag ? alan , Harlene Bautista , Will Fredo , Ferdinand Lapuz , and co-produced by Carlo Obispo and Maylyn Villalon Enriquez . It streams on Netflix . It won the Best Foreign Film at the 19th edition of LA Femme International Film Festival ( LAFIFF ) in Los Angeles , California . <p> The event was done in observance of the National Arts Month and with the cooperation of the local government of Ormoc and the local tourism office . The executive committee on cinema under the National Commission for Culture and the Arts was the main agency spearheading the celebration .

@@106772233 <h> The right thing <p> When the news broke last March 8 that Manasquan High School went to a New Jersey court to overturn a wrongful decision that led to their missing out on the state basketball championship game to Camden , it went viral . <p> True enough , Manasquan did win that game when a last-second follow-up shot went in that the referees validated . Then not surprisingly , huddled to validate the call , then shockingly overturned it . The officials later realized their error , but they already awarded the win to Camden . <p> Videos from the audience supported Manasquan 's win but since the officials had already left the court , the decision stood prompting Manasquan school officials to take this matter to the appellate court . <p> The court , perhaps in their good sense , said that judges refrain from matters of sports and that a football referee would also not be calling a baseball match and so forth . <p> This begs the following questions -- what lengths would we go to get a win , and given the opportunity to rectify a situation , why ca n't the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lengths where a school would go to get a win . I 'm not referring to the **26;1369;TOOLONG where schools utilize money to attract the best players or even cheat .

Had the court ruled in their favor , it would have opened not a can but a truckload of concerns that would put Pandora 's Box to shame . At least they exhausted what was available to them after game officials denied them . <p> For many students in high school sports , the state championship could possibly be the last time some of them will play sports or get an opportunity to win a championship that will be something to remember . As you go higher up the sports pyramid , it gets smaller and smaller because now , it involves foreign students for college , and come the pros , a finite number of slots available . <p> For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps the last true bastion of amateurism where one plays for the love of the game and to give glory to their alma mater . <p> So , the school has to try . <p> Now , why ca n't these situations be rectified ? Yes , I understand that the local tournament does not use instant replay or video technology . Yes , I understand that the rules state that the final decision must be awarded within the confines of the playing venue prior to the game officials leaving . <p> Pure and simple , the game and tournament officials botched it . They did admit to it . Granted it was contentious even while at the venue , they should have exhausted every means to get to the bottom of it while inside the playing venue . <p> We see this play out even in professional sports -- especially in the English Premier League where even with the benefit of video technology and multiple angles , they still make the wrong decision . <p> For example , the failure to call a penalty against Manchester City in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook up the top three slots of the ongoing title race . <p> The failure of the race official to place Max Verstappen in his proper position after a race stoppage caused not only Lewis Hamilton to lose the race , but also the driver 's championship .

They should have gathered the coaches of each team to come to the correct decision . <p> The correct decision . <p> Hmmn . There is that third question that is perhaps the most crucial -- why ca n't people , schools , or even entities do the right thing ? <p> I have seen a bunch of videos where the frontrunner in a marathon is literally feet away from the finish line and then collapses due to cramps . The runner right behind is agonized because this is an opportunity to win .

In the succeeding play , they allowed the opposing team to score as a means to reset the match . <p> And there 's Rapid Bucharest 's Costin Lazar who corrected a referee who wrongfully awarded a penalty to his side . Or when West Ham United forward Paulo Di Canio opted not to shoot at an empty Everton net when its goalkeeper fell injured . Yes , West Ham needed the points for that win but think about this -- the Hammers finished ninth in the league that season . Who remembers that ? Di Canio 's act of sportsmanship is still remembered . <p> That leads me back to the Manasquan-Camden game . As Manasquan went to court , it prompted Camden 's legal counsel to remark about their foe as " sour grapes . " The right thing for him and his school would have been to have kept quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the proper thing to do would have been to forfeit their faux win and instead give it to Manasquan .

Ltd. to stop CBRT construction activities on Province-owned lots on Osme ? a Blvd. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project . <p> On Feb. 27 , Garcia issued Memorandum 16-2024 ordering the contractor to stop the construction of the bus station in front of the Capitol building along Osme ? a Blvd. for its lack of authorization from the National Historical Commission of the Philippines , a violation of Republic Act 10066 or the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 . <p> Garcia took issue with the large leaf design of the bus station , which would obstruct the view of the pre-war era Provincial Capitol building . <p> At around the same time , Vice Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia , her nephew , also gave a privilege speech during the Cebu City Council 's regular session on Feb. 28 , voicing concerns about the visual impact of the CBRT project on the Cebu Provincial Capitol and seeking a better design for the project 's four bus stations that could be submitted to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts , Cultural and Historical Affairs Commission and the council for review . <p> The release of the memorandum by the governor displeased Rama , prompting him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President on March 20 , 2024 , in which he cited as grounds the governor 's alleged abuse of authority , oppression , grave misconduct , conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service , and violation of the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees , and the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act . <p> In his complaint , Rama blasted Garcia for only belatedly complaining about the bus station 's design , saying that the governor said nothing about this when she attended the project 's inauguration in February 2023 , and that she also did not object to the center islands on Osme ? a Blvd. hosting " several tall pine trees with the same height or even taller than the aesthetic canopies of the CBRT Project which undoubtedly covered or blocked the view " of the Capitol for decades . <p> Before Garcia issued her memorandum , CBRT manager Imbong had said Package 1 of the project was expected to be completed by early July 2024 . <p> Following the filing of the complaint against Garcia , Rama explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , citing them as a source of great pride ; however , he was still displeased with the governor 's meddling in the affairs of the city . <p> Original route <p> On reverting to the original CBRT route , Rama did not specify what exactly he meant by that . <p> But in a privilege speech last Wednesday , Cebu City Councilor James Anthony Cuenco , who chairs the committee on transportation and who has been a critic of the CBRT project , said that in an executive session last April 3 , mass transportation expert and consultant Rene Santiago and urban planner Nigel Paul Villarete said the current BRT routes primarily connect commercial centers like the Ayala mall and Cebu IT Park , rather than residential areas as originally intended . <p> Cuenco said they also questioned the request for a depot in the South Road Properties ( SRP ) , which was not aligned with the BRT 's original purpose . <p> The P28.78 billion CBRT , which spans 35.28 kilometers , is currently divided into four packages . <p> But Package 4 was not originally part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2023 , when major changes in the design of the project prompted Neda to raise the project cost from P16.3 billion . <p> Package 1 covers the route from Osme ? a Boulevard to the South Bus Terminal ( 2.38 kilometers ) ; Package 2 , route from the SRP , Barangay Mambaling , and Escario St. , Capitol , and Gorordo Ave .

Here is a delightful blend of action , comedy and romance that will make the audience feel like a Hollywood insider for a few hours ( although there are perhaps one too many jokes about Comic-Con and Hall H ) . <p> Loosely based on the 1980s Lee Majors television series about a stuntman who made some extra cash on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of said stunt guy , Colt Seavers . <p> Colt is a workaday stunt performer and longtime go-to for a major movie star , Tom Ryder ( Aaron Taylor-Johnson ) . Tom is the kind of deeply egotistical and self-conscious A-lister who tells everyone he does his own stunts and worries out loud about Colt 's jawline being distractingly softer than his . I think the word " potato " is thrown around as a descriptor . Taylor-Johnson has quite a bit of fun playing up all his eccentricities that you hope , and fear , are at least somewhat inspired by real horror stories of stars behaving badly . <p> The film comes from director David Leitch , the Brad Pitt stuntman and stunt coordinator who helped bring " John Wick " to the world and directed " Atomic Blonde " and " Bullet Train .

Forget the Oscar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy " is just one tiny step on the path to making audiences more aware of some of the behind-the-scenes people who really make movies better and risk it all to do so . <p> It 's revealing that the movie starts with Colt suffering a terrible injury on a set . The stunt that goes wrong is one he 's just done and does n't seem remotely nervous about . The film cuts to his recovery and semi-reclusive retirement until he gets a call from Tom 's producer Gail ( a delightfully over-the-top Hannah Waddingham ) begging Colt to come back for a new film . They need him , she pleads , as does his longtime crush Jody ( Blunt ) , who is making her directorial debut . She waits to inform him that Tom is missing and he 's the one who has to find him .

The first , titled " History and pork guts in wintry Beijing , " was published in Y2Z on April 14 . <p> Long before I ever stepped foot in China , my friend Tom ( that 's his English name ) told me many stories about growing up in his beloved hometown of Luliang , a seldom visited municipality in the province of Shanxi , several hundred kilometers west of Beijing . <p> The houses , Tom said , to save on construction costs , were often carved directly into the mountainside . The rock provided natural insulation against winter , which was always cold and dry . Food came in the form of millet , oats , and wheat , sometimes also mutton , goat meat , potato noodles , cucumbers , and aged black vinegar . But definitely not seafood . The ocean was so far away that Tom spent the first twenty or so years of his life without ever eating a fish . <p> By all accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I finally got the chance to visit late last February with my father , traveling by plane and rail during a snowy winter season , I expected to see what might best be described as a medieval hamlet : fallow fields , oxen , some small brick hovels huddled together against a frozen sky . <p> Instead , we arrived at the Luliang station by sleek green express train . ( " Only our town has a green train , " said Tom with more than a hint of pride . ) His nephew picked us up in an electric car . I stared a bit dumbly after getting inside . The car 's entire dashboard was a LED touchscreen . <p> My friend 's memories were apparently a bit outdated . Forget fish , I could quite clearly see the brand-new Nike sneakers shining from the windows of a corner outlet . Towering yellow cranes loomed over block after block of half-done apartments . High-rises , fashion boutiques , bars . Was that an Apple store ? <p> The streets flew by in dazed surprise . " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest small town that I 've ever seen ! " <p> I should n't have been shocked . Many things have changed since Tom 's childhood . China has become the second largest economy in the world . And for Shanxi at least , the galloping economic transformation has been fueled by one particular commodity : coal . <p> Shanxi 's black mineral <p> Shanxi contains a full third of China 's coal deposits . It produces over 300 million tons each year . Fortunes have been made by this black mineral , millionaires born by it . In 2012 , a coal mining magnate reportedly spent over 10 million dollars just to finance his daughter 's wedding . The fossil-fuel industry is so entrenched that the provincial capital , Taiyuan , hosts a huge coal museum with a life-sized replica mine situated in the basement . <p> When I managed to visit the coal museum one chill afternoon , a few days before heading to Luliang , I suddenly found myself conversing with a friendly young man who had approached me out of the blue . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Mingjie -- that was his name -- was a second-year undergraduate studying online logistics at Suzhou University , near Shanghai by the coast .

Is it hot there ? Do you know Shopee ? " Together we inspected the miniature factories , the model drills , the mounted slabs of anthracite . " Factories get big , " he said , spreading his arms wide . " Very , very big . " <p> We talked about his friends , his fondness for anime , his plans to travel abroad . How many languages did he know ? " Four , " said Mingjie . Mandarin , some English , a bit of Russian , and , of course , the language spoken by the people of his hometown , Xiaoyi .

The Chinese might share a common writing system , but at the same time every corner of the country hides its own speech , its own dialect , its own lively lingo , slang , and vernacular . <p> Hours passed in lively conversation . Finally , near the exit , by a slab of anthracite , I asked Mingjie , " Why 'd you come to this museum ? It does n't seem the place to learn more about supply chains . " He paused . " I wanted to know where I came from . My father is an engineer , " he said . " He supervises a plant . This , " he explained , gesturing around him , " is what 's paying for college .

Accidents plague its workers . Twelve were killed in mine accidents just this March alone . <p> At the same time , however , Taiyuan itself is a sprawling modern metropolis . The roads are well-kept , the streets are clean , and any smokestacks polluting the countryside are kept well away from the eyes of prying foreigners . Skyscrapers and high-rises line the main thoroughfare . In what may be the biggest of all ironies , Taiyuan was the first city in the world to replace its entire taxi fleet with electric vehicles . Fossil-fuel automobiles in general are startlingly rare . Just as shocking is the price of air fare . You can find flights from Manila to Taiyuan for less than a plane ride to Davao . <p> In fact , it 's a mystery why there seem to be so few foreign tourists in Shanxi . There are certainly more than enough fascinating landmarks to visit . At the Jin State Museum , you can find tombs far older than even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original archaeological excavations . Glass walkways extend over the remains of ancient princes lying stiff in deep pits , along with their chariots , their bronze axes , and the countless tortured skeletons of their sacrificed warhorses , who were buried alive with their masters . <p> The only difficulty about Shanxi 's museums is the lack of translations . All signs are in Chinese . To understand them you need to hire a guide , or better yet , get the help of a local . <p> " We are surrounded by the sea " <p> Back at Luliang , during our last full day there , the entire town was busy preparing for the Lantern Festival to mark the first full moon of the new lunar year . There would be a parade led by a dancing dragon and , later that evening , a grand firework show . <p> First , however , my father and I needed to find breakfast outside our hotel .

@@108099238 <p> Context is key in one 's enjoyment of the 1970 Beatles documentary " Let It Be , " now re-released in a restored version on the Disney+ streaming service . <p> Although it was filmed in January 1969 , " Let It Be " first came out in May 1970 , one month after Paul McCartney publicly announced his breakaway from the Fab Four , and hence , the documentary was interpreted as a sad and mournful swan song for the supergroup . <p> Today , in the wake of Peter Jackson 's " The Beatles : Get Back " docuseries in 2021 which utilized unused " Let It Be " footage and reputedly depicted a more joyous aura of the band , the latter comes off as a shorter version of " Get Back " with a seemingly happy and relaxed vibe . <p> Why the radical difference ? For one , the documentary , helmed by music video director Michael Lindsay-Hogg , is shot " cinema verite " style , thus eliminating narration that would slant the movie towards any clear historical or emotional context . All that one objectively sees is a band cooped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsals and jammings , expressing moments of both cheerful energy and ennui , and in just one occasion , getting on each other 's nerves . Are they sluggish and bored out of their skulls , or -- using an expression that was n't available at that time -- simply being " chill " ? <p> They play and sing a variety of **32;1635;TOOLONG songs in their raw form , including the solemn title cut with slightly varied lyrics ( " There will be no sorrow . " ) and portions where McCartney as the soloist skips the higher notes . In the early goings , we hear " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer , " which would become one of the sillier cuts in the Beatles ' farewell album " Abbey Road . " <p> We sense the power play in which McCartney appears to be calling all the shots , and John Lennon , with wife-to-be Yoko Ono in black as a silent but constant presence , playing along and not minding at all . On the other hand , there 's George Harrison 's passive-aggressive conversation with McCartney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll play what you want me to play . " When Harrison later joins Ringo Starr in a joyful rendition of Starr 's kiddie song " Octopus 's Garden , " we realize the hierarchy being established : McCartney and Lennon ( and maybe even Yoko ) are the bosses , and Harrison and Starr are the underlings , the former getting to be a rather disgruntled one . <p> Nonetheless , the bearded McCartney comes off as a benevolent director , trying to pull the group together with persuasion rather than force . Lennon , who had long been regarded as the group 's leader , simply coasts along , perhaps ( allegedly ) with the help of substances or because he is obliged to behave in front of Ono . <p> All the Beatles are shown to be individually talented , making their eventual split feel perhaps less painful . All of them can play and sing with gusto , Starr perhaps to a lesser extent for some in the vocal department , but he does show off his flair in novelty tunes like " Garden " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case you might ask : no , Ono does not sing here . <p> What both the sad sack and the Polyanna viewers can probably agree on is that the film ends in a kind of liberation when the Fab Four finally bust out of their self-imposed isolation in the Apple Corps studio and perform a number of songs on its rooftop , in a way prefiguring the outdoor Woodstock Festival that would occur some months later , and drawing the curiosity and at times , consternation , of onlooking Britons on the street . It 's a dramatic finish that perks up the previous laid-back vibe . <p> So , can we then say that " Let It Be , " shorn of obvious affective gaslighting , shows the unvarnished truth ? Not so fast . Lindsay-Hogg has admitted that the iconic Apple rooftop scenario was no spontaneous Fab Four move , but his deliberate attempt to end the docu with a bang . The gambit , as we all know , pays off , in a case of subtle cinematic manipulation trumping slice-of-life reality . <p> In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary on how the Beatles , with producer George Martin , created the album " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , " arguably their most ambitious and critically praised effort , and perhaps the studio atmosphere would have been more inspired and excited . <p> But why complain ? Whether you end up weeping , laughing or simply high , " Let It Be " remains a precious and early , relatively concise , in-your-face documentation of a great , if not the greatest , pop band at work . Either way , it moves you . Rating : 4 out of 5 stars .

I 've seen this before , I thought , despite the truth that until that moment I had never been remotely close to Ljubljana . For a moment , facing east , I stood in place as the river of tourists continued to rush past me , and gazed : the monument to France Pre ? eren , Slovenia 's most famous poet , in front of me , the distinctive pink Franciscan Church to my left , the iconic art nouveau facade of the Galerija Emporium behind it , the Triple Bridge crossing the Ljublanica River to my right . A short walk along the river are other famous bridges built or renovated by the architect Jo ? e Plecnik : the Cobbler 's Bridge , Dragon Bridge , and further along , the Trnovo Bridge . Thanks to the countless travel guides I consulted and the hi-res Google Maps photos I browsed before flying , my mind already had fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of course , images do not compare to presence . Breathing in the busy air at the riverwalks , listening to the cacophony of languages around me , and walking the cobbled streets in my trusty old boots continue to be experiences that evade the snares of virtuality ( so far ) . It is hard to miss how Plecnik 's style -- " traditional but modern " is the concise way it is often described as -- has genuinely elevated Ljubljana in palpable ways . Human-centered , the city is a marvel of history and innovation , art and function . It 's a delight to be here . That I am in this beautiful city because of a poetry prize I had won last year astounds me every time I think about it . This opportunity affords me the pleasure of living in a new city for a month , and an abundance of time to dedicate to my creative work . Immersed in an entirely new environment , my mind feels sharp . From having to learn basic Slovene to get by to tracing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my toes . <p> So much of Ljubljana has inspired awe in me , but one that I keep going back to is the thought of how much the stones of these centuries-old buildings have endured -- and , more importantly , the intentional efforts of people to breathe new life into them with the intention to honor collective memory . The Ljubljana Castle , for instance , is a 12th century medieval fortress that has been renovated with a care that , to me , did not diminish its heritage but exalted it . With a vision inherited from Plecnik , modern design and accessibility features have transformed this historic building into a cultural venue in such a way that the integrity of the original structure is maintained while making space for the needs of the present . A glass elevator partly covered by ivy is tucked between old stone next to what was once an open-air prison cell . A two-way spiral staircase -- ingeniously designed ! -- painted a bright red allows visitors to safely climb to the peak of a tower that offers a fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely renovated into an exhibition space that , at the time of my visit , showcased photographs by Marjan Ciglic . Beautiful photographs from the nineties , taken by the legendary Slovenian photojournalist , are displayed in the same room with walls that date back to the 1100s . Exploring the castle is feat of time travel . <p> In many ways , the Old Town of Ljubljana , where the residency apartment is located , is everything I imagined a European city would be . The cobblestone streets , countless bars and cafes in old buildings , stylish boutiques carrying local and artisan goods , incredibly well-dressed strangers . In walking through the streets I am keenly aware of the juxtaposition of everything I 've read and seen about Europe -- stereotypes and historical facts alike -- on the present moment of my living in it . In exploring this new place , I do not start from scratch . Instead , with every day I spend here learning more about the place and its people , I am constantly overwriting what I know , building on my repository @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing that Slovenia was once part of the former Yugoslavia is one thing ; learning more intimate accounts of the experience of living through its violent dissolution is another . The fight for independence and recognition , the transition from a socialist republic to a parliamentary democracy , and the complicated feelings left in its aftermath must have taken a fierceness that , to me , manifests in the way Slovenes take pride in their language and culture . On her language , Slovenian novelist and critic Ana Schnabl writes , " The language I love is a game . I can approach it playfully and unconcernedly , but if ladies with red scarves encroach on my space , I will react fiercely , defensively . " With such passion for their language , it should n't come as a surprise then to know that Ljubljana , home to 35 public libraries , multiple publishing houses , literary institutions , and book festivals , is one of 53 UNESCO Cities of Literature . In a conversation we had about the prolific literary production in the city , Miha Mauric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center hosting my residency , said , " It was almost like literature saved our language . " <p> I see this fierceness , too , in the abundance of street art all over the city . Political sentiments , cartoon animals , colorful abstractions , and stickers create layered tapestries on city walls . They speak what is often unutterable , and mark the presence of those that have been rendered invisible . It is not insignificant that the heart of Ljubljana 's underground culture is Metelkova mesto , the former headquarters of the Yugoslav National Army . The artists and communities that have occupied this space since the nineties have fought against its conversion into a commercial space and for its recognition as an autonomous cultural center . Today this complex , covered with murals and sculptures everywhere you look , is a hub of creative activity . From Ljubljana to Manila , street art is a resistance against silence . <p> Woven into the story of Ljubljana is the symbol of the dragon . The legend goes : the mythological Greek hero Jason encountered a dragon dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medea , he had to slay . Transformed in the story , the dragon is now said to be perched atop the castle tower , guarding the city and its people . One can sense this fierce , watchful spirit in the graffiti on city walls , the vitality of the local literary scene , the fervor with which Slovenes define and defend their identity . A kind of radical love , I think . That the city name resembles the Slovene word for " the beloved " , " ljubljena " , acquires a new dimension in this light . <p> When I am abroad , I ca n't help but think of home . The differences , both welcome and unwelcome , rise to the forefront of my attention as if on instinct , resulting in a mental concept map of where I am in relation to everywhere I 've ever been to . The tender warmth of speaking to Filipino strangers is missed when I speak to Slovenes , though they are far from unfriendly . Coming from car-centric Texas and the chaotic streets of Manila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always surprises me . The robust public transportation in the city also strikes me as a wonder . Within a ten-minute walk from the residency apartment are , by my count , at least 12 bookstores , and this excludes the bookstores inside the nearby museums . Save for a small shelf or pile of books in English , German , or Italian , these bookstores purvey an incredible variety of books in Slovene . Meanwhile , from Johnson City , I would have to drive an hour for one . I thought , too , all the Filipino independent presses I wish had spaces of their own in which to gather the existing love for literature dispersed throughout the metro . <p> Time , too , as shaped by external markers is different , at least in the touristy Old Town : retail stores close at 7 or 8 o'clock , versus Manila 's 9:00 or 10:00 PM . Many establishments here are also closed on Sundays , which , in Manila , can actually be one of the busiest days of the week , especially with the integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ljubljana , servers never volunteer to bring the cheque after plates have been cleared , whereas in the US , it is often brought to the table even before you 've asked for it with the gentle reminder of whenever you 're ready . The norm here , it seems , is that diners spend a significant amount of time after their meal conversing -- sometimes with a drink , often while having a smoke . <p> Bordered by Austria to the north , Hungary to the northeast , Croatia to the southeast , and Italy to the west , Slovenia is considered a crossroads between central and eastern Europe . Indeed , cross-cultural influences abound in the capital . Jo ? e Plecnik 's architectural vision for Ljubljana as we know it carries similiarities with the aesthetics of the Vienna Secession . The ruins of a Roman wall stands less than a kilometer away from Trg republike , one of the city 's Yugoslav-era monuments . Dragon Street Food along Ciril-Metodov trg sells cylindrical pastries they call Dragon Fire Bread that , as my spontaneous lunch companion from Frankfurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles the Czech trdln ? k and the German Baumstriezel . <p> Whenever I ask my colleagues from Poland , Croatia , Bulgaria or Georgia to tell me about the specificity of their national culture , I always pretty much get one and the same answer : " Our country is on the border between the East and the West ; its culture is a mixture of Eastern and Western traditions . <p> That was certainly a familiar sentiment ( with , of course , a more nuanced context within the discourse of European history ) , even though I do not come from any of those countries . Manila , with its deep colonial history and geographical proximity to multiple diverse nations , is also often described as a melting pot . Even the little town of Johnson City in Texas -- which , to begin with , was once part of Mexico -- has its obvious Mexican , German , and even French influences . What are we if not the collision -- fusion , repulsion , and all -- of everything that has touched us ? Culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite , purity , is a delusion . <p> About the author <p> My name is Lian . I am a writer from Manila currently based in a small town in central Texas .

@@108346237 <h> POGO or POGuo ? <p> I am inclined to revisit the quaint municipality of Bamban , Tarlac . After all , I was assigned there when I was a young lieutenant serving the 7th Infantry Division . I heard that a World War II Museum houses relics and other artifacts , along with historical information on the Japanese occupation during WW II in the Philippines . Bamban holds historical significance as a notable location along the route of the Bataan Death March , commemorated by the solemn Death March Marker . Lately , my curiosity about this place has been piqued due to news reports revolving around the municipality 's lady mayor , Alice L. Guo . <p> It all started with the Senate investigations on issues concerning Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations . The lady mayor 's name was then linked to two POGO firms in Bamban -- Hongsheng Gaming Technology Incorporated and Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated . Per reports , Hongsheng was raided in February 2023 and was replaced by Zun Yuan in the same location . It was raided yet again in March 2024 for charges of alleged human trafficking and serious illegal detention . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the compound of Zun Yuan , following complaints of a Vietnamese national who escaped from the facility . Last week , 165 of Zun Yuan 's workers were deported to Pudong District , Shanghai , China . <p> During the hearing , Senator Win Gatchalian bared Guo 's alleged ties to the firms , citing an electric billing statement of Zun Yuan and a vehicle seized during the raid , which was registered under her name . To these allegations , Mayor Guo boldly answered that she used to be an incorporator of Baoufu or the compound where the Pogo firms were located but she later divested before she became a mayor . As to the vehicle found in the compound ( probably the pearl white Rolls Royce ) , Guo said she used to own it but the same was also sold in 2020 . <p> The Senate panel head , Senator Risa Hontiveros , could not be swayed , as she delved into the personal background of the lady mayor , which inquiry merited more questions than answers . <p> Guo 's identity as a Filipino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she claimed that she did not know her mother , even when residents in Bamban claimed to have seen her with her mother , father and siblings for quite some time since she was 10 years old . <p> Guo 's father , Jian Zhong Guo ( Filipino name : Angelito Guo ) , with whom she grew up raising hogs , was registered as Chinese national in the documents pertaining to his embroidery business . Mayor Guo likewise stated that she was homeschooled until high school and never got into college , but she could not remember the name of the homeschool provider . <p> Interestingly too , Hontiveros revealed that there was no hospital record of Guo 's birth , and that the mayor only had her birth certificate registered in the year 2013 when she was already 17 . <p> Based on her certificate of candidacy in the 2022 elections , Guo was born on July 12 , 1986 . She won the elections as an independent candidate with 16,503 votes , besting her rival by a small margin . Prior to assuming the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown figure , as per reports . <p> Even President Ferdinand Marcos Jr . recently stated that no one among Tarlac 's local politicians had heard of Guo before her victory in the 2022 elections . Apparently , the crux of the matter is that Guo 's identity as a Filipino citizen is being questioned over her alleged involvement in an illegal POGO firm . <p> The implications must be serious as both the Office of the Solicitor General and the Department of the Interior and Local Government ( DILG ) have formed their respective teams to gather information on the lady mayor 's possible connection with illegal POGO operations . The investigation could go as far as questioning Guo 's right to " holding or exercising public office , " according to the OSG . Thus , too , per the Commission on Elections , Guo runs the risk of facing perjury charges should her alleged foreign origins be proven to be true . Under the law , only Filipino citizens -- either natural born or naturalized citizens -- are eligible to run for a mayoralty position . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other documentation to prove their age or citizenship , apart from their sworn oath upon filing of their COC . And with Mayor Guo , no protest or quo warranto petition was filed against her . <p> Through it all , the core issue raised during the Senate hearing is the determination of the lady mayor 's possible link to China as its " spy " to infiltrate the Philippines and wield influence on the government . Whether our government agencies ran slack somewhere in the " handling " or monitoring of Mayor Guo is another story altogether . The identity crisis hounding Mayor Guo seems to spin the roulette for a national crisis . <p> Without pre-judging Mayor Guo , it is imperative that we understand our solid identity . Our belief in a cemented identity produces correct existence , just as one Pastor says that right believing produces right living ( not the other way around ) . Hence , our strong conviction that we are Filipino citizens generates actuations that should be aligned with our being as a Filipino . For instance , a true Filipino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign coast guard vessel is harassing a fellow Filipino in our own maritime territory . Any person who believes he is a Filipino but does not feel infuriated against those water cannon activities is not a true Filipino . <p> The identity crisis in citizenship is as real as in the spiritual realm . Nonetheless , with appropriate knowledge , the predicament can be readily resolved . As believers of Jesus Christ , our identity is fortified and can never be altered . One pastor from Toronto , Canada says it more accurately : " If you are a follower of Jesus Christ , your core identity is that you are a child of God , " citing what Paul wrote in Ephesians 1:5-6 of the Bible that " He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself , according to the good pleasure of his will , to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One . " John 1:12 reminds us : " But to all who did receive him , he gave them the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of God ( right believing ) should lead us to right living . When asked about his identity , a firm believer ought not to do a " Guo " and claim " I do n't remember . " When grounded in faith , a believer can confidently remember everything that Jesus Christ did for him and the rest of the world . There is neither the question of POGO or POGuo , Chinese or Filipino , spy or patriot -- but only " children of our Heavenly Father .

Borlongan oversaw the creation of a maquette , a miniature clay model that served as a blueprint for the final seven-ft. sculpture . The completed clay model was then shipped to China for casting . The resulting trio of bronze sculptures now graces three distinct locations : Gopiao 's serene pond in his getaway in Lucban , Quezon ; the garden surrounding Borlongan 's studio in San Antonio , Zambales ; and soon , a spot in the artist 's own pond , bringing the fun water play of Shoulder Wars full circle . <p> Borlongan , celebrated for his evocative expressionist style , drew inspiration for Shoulder Wars from cherished memories of childhood summers , filled with laughter and lighthearted competition . During summer breaks , lads would engage in this tussle on the beach or pool , displaying not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies . <p> " Elmer Borlongan 's work has always captured the essence of Filipino culture with a unique blend of nostalgia and modernity . This exhibit is a testament to his ability to evoke deep emotions through both painting and sculpture , " Jonathan Matti , known for his sophisticated and elegant design style , says . <p> Borlongan is a city-turned-country boy . Born in Manila , he now calls Zambales home . But the works that gained him renown depict struggles of the common man in the urban jungle . At the University of the Philippines , he was associated with social realism , a movement that utilized visual art as a critique of society . His social realist phase , which began in the late ' 80s , transitioned towards a softer approach in the early ' 90s . Eventually , Borlongan found himself drawn to figurative expressionism , where the artist 's emotional response to a subject takes precedence over a purely objective representation of reality . His shift was influenced by his participation in the Salingpusa art group . <p> " We were searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We were city boys . We painted our environment . " <p> " My approach is how to interpret your subject matter from your heart , " he explains . This focus on interpretation is evident in his signature style " characterized by exaggerated figures to evoke heightened emotion . " <p> His works are unique , and are like pebbles in a pond . They create ripples . <p> Now , Borlongan 's amateur wrestlers have seemingly jumped from the canvas to the floor . Still scuffling , they are now three-dimensional . This gives the viewer the opportunity to view the sculpture from all angles and to enter their worlds without the background given in the painting . <p> Where are they ? If not by the sea , then where ? <p> " I leave it up to the viewers to make their own interpretation on what the two figures represent . If you situate it in current events , it could be the Philippines and China competing for territories in the West Philippine Sea , " Borlongan muses . <p> The exhibit opened shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the two protagonists were borne on the shoulders of their supporters . As it is in life -- our victories are enabled by the people who carry us on their shoulders . <p> Shoulder Wars could be anything . Anyone . But what is apparent is the determination on the faces of the " wrestlers . " Now , you do n't have to sit on anyone 's shoulder to see that . *

That is normal among aspiring entrepreneurs . But overcoming it takes a bit of work . <p> In their RCBC Boz Sessions , a video series featuring Filipino entrepreneurs , Rissa Mananquil-Trillo , co-founder of skincare and makeup brand Happy Skin , and Cy Ynares of online bakeshop The Bald Baker shared how they were able to shake off their jitters and anxieties about managing their business when they were starting out . <p> For Rissa Mananquil Trillo , it 's a matter of making the most out of opportunities and addressing a gap in the industry that needed to be filled . Trillo said she created Happy Skin in 2013 when she realized there were no skin-caring makeup brands available in the country specifically made for the Philippine weather and the Filipino skin . " Instead of waiting for someone to come up with a solution to a personal pain point , I thought , why not create it ? " she said . <p> " Unlike most people who start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a way out of the corporate world , or the desire to have more free time .

" I think that it will always be remembered as the homegrown brand that opened doors for both entrepreneurs and consumers to embrace loving local , " she said . <p> Meanwhile , Ynares started his online bakeshop in 2014 after his friends encouraged him to open a shop where they can buy his cookies . " At that time , there really were n't a lot of people offering cooking and online Instagram shops were n't even a thing yet back then , " he explained . The marketer-turned-baker 's cookies got the attention of bazaars and food journalists , proving to him that there is a market for his product . Hence , The Bald Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ynares offered during their RCBC Boz Sessions on how aspiring entrepreneurs can overcome their fears . <p> Find the right partner <p> Starting entrepreneurs are bound to feel pressure as they iron out the issues of their new business .

" Being able to achieve more as a woman can be as simple as having the right support system , " Trillo shared . <p> " It can come in the form of a partner who shares in the care work at home , or as simple as having the right digital tools to make life easier . " <p> And this is the case for Ynares . The Bald Baker is a one-man team , but he finds moral support from his life partner and friends who encouraged him to start his cookie business . <p> Prepare for growth <p> For Trillo , the biggest mistake a small business can make is to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started operations in 2013 with only five employees . They slowly hired full-time employees as the workload grew . <p> Trillo 's advice ? " Do n't wait to grow the team only when you feel too busy . Perhaps while waiting too long , you would 've saved money , but you would 've also slowed down the growth of your company . " <p> But growth does not only mean expanding the business in terms of manpower . In Ynares ' case , he chose to run The Bald Baker as a one-man team because he believes it is the setup that will serve him and his business the best . He slowly leveled up some components of his business , from improving the packaging , upgrading to premium ingredients , to having his own website which he proudly made by himself . <p> Ynares explained : " But you know , I remember someone telling me , your journey 's different from everyone else . And as clich ? as this may sound , it really does n't matter how fast you get there . Enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own pace . " Learn to work smart <p> Hard work is important . And it helps for entrepreneurs to be hands on to and know every aspect of their business operations . But Trillo said they should not feel scared or guilty if they feel they can not do everything themselves . Trillo said , " Here 's the truth : hard work alone does n't always lead to business growth . " <p> Trillo believes running a successful business is about optimizing , outsourcing , and automating whatever you can . It 's very possible to spend all your time doing things that are n't actually leading to growth of your company . " " Productivity is n't about being busy ; it 's about focusing on the right tasks that drive results , " she also said . <p> Ynares admits he initially thought he had to do everything himself , too . " When I started taking cookie orders , it was fairly easy in the beginning , cause I was just getting about 10 orders a week or so .

Blackpink Lisa 's ' Rockstar ' prompts debate <p> Right after Lisa of Blackpink released her new solo single " Rockstar " on June 28 , a heated debate ignited online between Korean and Thai fans about whether the song should be classified as K-pop or Thai pop . <p> Lisa moved to Korea in 2011 at the age of 14 and underwent more than five years of training at YG Entertainment before debuting as a member of what is now K-pop 's most successful girl group . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Korean fans argue that her identity as a K-pop star justifies calling her new single a K-pop song . In contrast , Thai fans claim it is Thai pop , pointing to the music video 's strong emphasis on her Thai heritage . The video features a local dance team and was directed by Thai producers . <p> Some Korean music critics , meanwhile , argue Lisa 's work is an example of the " localizing " strategy that K-pop powerhouses like Hybe , SM Entertainment , and JYP Entertainment are pursuing for future growth . <p> " Lisa , who debuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to global stardom , is now pioneering a new market in the US mainstream music market as a pop star . Her new single ' Rockstar , ' shot in Thailand with local staff , marks the beginning of her career as an Asian pop star , which is not common worldwide , " music critic Kim Do-heon said Wednesday . <h> ' Localizing ' K-pop <p> Popular culture critic Cha Woo-jin said , " Lisa , a K-pop star trained in Korea and originally from Thailand , demonstrates that the ' globalization ' or ' localizing ' that K-pop has aspired to can occur in cities outside of Seoul . " <p> But Lisa 's case is slightly different from the usual " localization " vision pursued by K-pop agencies , which focuses on discovering talented local youngsters , putting them through a K-pop training process , and debuting them in specific regional markets . <p> In Lisa 's case , " Rockstar " is released through a partnership between her own independent management company , Lloud , and global record label RCA . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> However it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home country , leveraging her K-pop experience , and now aims to rank on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US as a new Asian solo artist . <p> " The key is to maintain the K-pop style while also appealing to the local audience . Nowadays , the gap between K-pop and American pop genres has significantly narrowed . Although idol bands were popular in the global pop market until the early to mid-2000s , their presence has since diminished , which I believe has a reason , " said Lim on Wednesday . <p> " Personally , I do n't think multiple members are necessary to enjoy music . For K-pop groups to attract local fans , the elements that excite K-pop fans need to become more mainstream , " he said . <p> Lisa has kept up with international musical trends by releasing sped-up and slowed-down versions of " Rockstar , " playing with beats-per-minute variations . With the rise of short-form content on platforms like TikTok , there 's a growing need to pack a lot into videos under a minute long , making sped-up versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lisa continues to showcase her pop star persona aimed at electronic hip-hop artists , just as she did in her previous hit " Money " released in 2022 . Offering five different versions of her tracks , including sped-up and slowed-down versions , makes it easier for DJs to use them in remixes at clubs and parties .

@@110294230 <h> Tales from the crib <p> I have a confession to make . I have been sleeping in the play pen every night . This was the latest of a series of parenting concessions I have had to make . The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommends that the safest way for a baby to sleep is on their own in a crib , without pillows or blankets that could smother them . Co-sleeping comes with increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome , though studies have shown that it is sleeping with a parent who drinks and smokes that mostly contributes to this . Having a baby sleep on their own , however , is much more difficult than the guidelines seem to suggest . Unfortunately , I have never gotten the hang of putting my baby down on his crib without waking him up . I had to contend with what works for us : sleeping next to him , ready for the inevitable night feeds which somehow lead to a better night 's sleep for all of us . Once he learned how to roll over , we moved our mattress inside the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping separately , we decided to join our two worlds . <p> I have also not been able to hold on to my " no-devices " rule . ( I would still strongly encourage parents to follow AAP 's guidelines on screen time , which include no screen time until 2 years old and only an hour per day for toddlers . ) What I did not anticipate prior to having children was that this guideline is only feasible if parents can also limit their screen time . It is hard to keep my baby away from screens when his father is watching television in our one-bedroom apartment . The only time I 've been able to limit his screen time is when we 're visiting a place without a TV or where there are multiple rooms so that my TV-loving family ( myself included ) can watch away from the baby . <p> Imagine my guilt , as a mental health professional who has been advising parents for years , that I could not enforce these guidelines on my own children . Experiencing parenthood firsthand made me empathize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As developers of guidelines and policies , it is important to put value into the experience of people expected to follow them and to understand what gets in the way . As I reflect on what would have helped me be more consistent with official parenting guidelines , I realize that these rules assume you have all the resources you need . They assume that you have sufficient physical space to carry out safe sleep protocols . They assume you have the funds to buy a crib or to provide a child with their own room . The AAP 's newborn and infant nutrition guidelines assume you can breastfeed and that , starting from six months onward , you have access to fresh produce and have the time to prepare them from scratch every day . The screen time guidelines assume you have either alternative ways to entertain your child or have around-the-clock child minders . <p> Let me be clear , I am not against the guidelines . What I am discovering , however , is that these guidelines are incomplete . They do not tell us how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space or funds for a crib . They do not tell us how to keep a child safe and entertained whenever we have to go to the bathroom ( I have heard stories of mothers pulling their play pens right outside of their open bathrooms so they can continue to keep watch ) . They do not tell us how to keep ourselves entertained outside of our devices so we can be better role models for our children . Good guidelines need to be flexible and allow parents acceptable options or alternatives in case the ideal scenario is not possible . I 'm sure a lot of us would very much like to know how we can still do the best we can for our children even if we have very limited resources . <p> We also need to keep in mind that guidelines are just that , guides . They are good-faith suggestions that we can adapt to our current situation or environment .

" <p> To put it briefly , dear readers , oil prices are not solely determined by the usual expenses associated with oil production .

The historically religious significance attributed to a fiesta -- that it is originally intended to celebrate the locale 's devotion to its patron saint through " sacred " activities , is already lost here . From being regarded as a " sacred " custom by the generations who lived decades or even centuries ago , the Wattah Wattah Festival had lost its sanctity and had transformed into something " profane " -- a mere secular event popularly known to motorists as the " basaan " day in San Juan which should be avoided at all costs lest be bombarded with water from unknown sources . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> While the prevailing sentiment online revolves around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unruly residents of San Juan , there are a few who remain to have some ray of hope toward these unruly residents , arguing that perhaps they were just temporarily lost in the height of the merriment . <p> In the end , one can only hope that in the coming celebrations of the Wattah Wattah Festival , newly repented and " baptized " versions of these celebrants would come to surface -- for fiestas such as the Wattah Wattah Festival should be a source of belongingness and connection , a means to strengthen our bonds as Filipinos , instead of becoming a source of conflict and division .

They were interspersed with , among others , a close-up of an old person the ravages of time etched on her face , a father and son working together for their catch from the sea , and a stray cat with a playful bird hounding its tail . <p> At the end of each row were shots of peaceful and tranquil scenes to round out the previous portrayals of toil and daily grind .

@@111010239 <h> DLSU amplifies research excellence with investments in research talent and technology <p> Manila , Philippines -- De La Salle University ( DLSU ) , a leading learner-centered and research university , has reinforced its commitment to advancing research excellence and nation-building . Through strategic investments in its human resources and research infrastructure , the university aims to make substantive contributions to national and global aspirations . <p> " At DLSU , we understand that quality is the first imperative in research . Our aspirations for real-world impact should have a firm foundation in scientific rigor , " says Prof. Raymond Tan , Vice President for Research and Innovation at DLSU . " We are committed to using our research as a basis for addressing national interest and global challenges , provided that our work meets universally accepted quality standards . " <h> Investing in research in engineering , science , and technology <p> DLSU recently initiated several groundbreaking technology-driven research programs . For instance , Prof. Nilo Bugtai founded the Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Health Technologies ( IBEHT ) . His team is developing a suite of robots for therapeutic applications , particularly for the rehabilitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Science and Technology ( DOST ) , and aims to provide affordable , high-quality healthcare solutions for both the Philippine and export markets . <p> " As a comprehensive , non-profit , private Catholic university in a lower middle-income country , we recognize both the challenges and opportunities in addressing national and global issues , " says Dr. Tan . " The university 's best minds are actively engaged in research that addresses many of the Sustainable Development Goals . " <p> Over the past five years , DLSU has launched several research centers focusing on diverse priority areas or global trends . These include the Andrew L. Tan Data Science Institute ( ALTDSI ) , the Enrique Razon Logistics Institute ( ERLI ) , the IBEHT , and the Southeast Asian Research Center and Hub ( SEARCH ) . <p> The university also established the Central Instrumentation Facility ( CIF ) in its Laguna Campus , the current hub of the university 's research infrastructure enhancements . CIF boasts state-of-the-art laboratory equipment , including a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy laboratory and a wind tunnel , designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partners . <h> Harnessing AI and data science in research <p> DLSU is also leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ) to bolster data analysis capabilities . For example , a study led by Prof. Allan Bernardo and researchers from ALTDSI used machine learning to analyze large datasets from the Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) . The PISA results have raised alarms about the poor state of the country 's education system . <p> Their analysis has yielded intriguing insights . Recognizing the significant impact of the home environment on student performance , the team concluded that effective policy interventions can not rely solely on the Department of Education 's mandate . Improving the quality of education will require a " whole of government " approach to the problem . <p> Moreover , DLSU has made substantial investments in a high-performance computing facility as part of ALTDSI , further augmenting its capacity for AI and data science research . <p> " At DLSU , research is a crucial educational experience for students , offering firsthand insight into the advancement of scientific knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriches students ' understanding but also equips them with transferable soft skills , such as critical thinking and effective communication , which are invaluable for their future careers even if they do not become researchers . " <h> Promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and impact <p> DLSU believes in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration for addressing complex real-world problems . Integrating perspectives from diverse fields such as arts and social sciences , business , computer technology , education , engineering , law , and natural science reduces the risk of " blind spots " that can result from narrow vantage points . DLSU supports such collaboration by funding mini-grants and workshops that allow researchers to step out of their specialist silos . <p> For instance , Prof. Bernardo 's multidisciplinary team offers evidence-based insights to the Second Congressional Commission on Education ( EDCOM 2 ) , thus helping rationally shape the country 's educational policies . The team is currently conducting research aimed at addressing critical problems in the nation 's basic and higher education ecosystem . <p> Through its partnership with DLSU , EDCOM II has published five studies on bullying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for amendments to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 10627 , advocating for strengthened provisions related to the Child Protection Committee , improved systems for reporting bullying cases , and clarification of the Department of Education 's structures and procedures concerning bullying . <p> To support its goal of becoming a more influential university , DLSU plans to increase international collaboration and publications in top-tier journals . The university will prioritize research endeavors addressing pressing issues both locally , such as quality education , poverty alleviation , and economic growth , and globally , including climate change , artificial intelligence , and health and wellness . <p> In 2015 , DLSU revised its mission-vision to become a " learner-centered and research university , " which paved the way for rapid growth in research across the institution . " As we look ahead to the 50th anniversary of our university charter in 2025 , our new strategic plan articulates a bold vision to extend our sphere of influence beyond the Philippines , " says Prof. Tan . <p> The university continues to invest in its talent pool and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerhouse .

Russian President Vladimir Putin has monitored drills of the country 's strategic nuclear forces involving multiple practice launches of ballistic and cruise missiles . The Kremlin said in a statement that all the test-fired missiles reached their designated targets . <p> Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 , President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin voices have frequently threatened the West with its nuclear arsenal . <p> On Day 1 of the war , Putin said " whoever tries to impede us , let alone create threats for our country and its people , must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to consequences you have never seen in history .

Russian hawks have called for revising the country 's nuclear doctrine to lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons , and President Vladimir Putin said the doctrine could be modified . <p> Over nearly 2 1/2 years of fighting , the West has given Ukraine billions of dollars of advanced weapons , some of which have struck Russian soil . And while there have been more Kremlin threats -- and even the deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons in Belarus , just over the border from Ukraine -- so far it has remained only a blunt message . <p> What could finally trigger a nuclear response ? <p> Asked that in June by international news agencies , Putin pointed to Russia 's so-called nuclear doctrine . <p> " Look what is written there , " he said at the St. Petersburg session .

Putin said that Moscow could revise its nuclear doctrine outlining conditions for atomic weapons use to take into account the evolving global situation . <p> Now Russian hawks are urging him to change the doctrine to lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons , and Putin says the document could be modified to take into account the evolving global situation . <p> What is Russia 's nuclear doctrine ? <p> Formally known as the " Basic Principles of State Policy on Nuclear Deterrence , " it was signed by Putin in 2020 and outlines when Russia could dip into its atomic arsenal , the world 's largest . <p> It describes nuclear weapons as " a means of deterrence , " noting that their use is an " extreme and compelled measure . " It declares that Russia " takes all necessary efforts to reduce the nuclear threat and prevent aggravation of interstate relations that could trigger military conflicts , including nuclear ones . " <p> The document states that " nuclear deterrence is aimed to provide comprehension by a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression against the Russian Federation and/or its allies . " <p> What does it say will trigger using nuclear weapons ? <p> Russia could use them , the doctrine says , " in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies , as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy . " <p> It says nuclear weapons could be used under the following specific situations : <p> * If reliable information is received about the launch of ballistic missiles targeting the territory of Russia or its allies . <p> * If nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction are used against Russia or its allies . <p> * If there are attacks on critically important Russian government or military facilities that could undermine the country 's retaliatory nuclear strike capability . <p> Has any attack so far come close to crossing this threshold ? <p> As Russia attacked parts of northeastern Ukraine near the city of Kharkiv , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes in Russian territory in the border region . But these attacks have been limited in scope and would not seem to pose an existential threat that would fall under the nuclear doctrine . <p> However , the hawks in Moscow have pointed to a series of Ukrainian attacks on Russian air bases that host long-range nuclear capable bombers earlier in the conflict , as well as recent raids on early warning radars . <p> They say these circumstances would seem to warrant the use of nuclear weapons as laid out in the doctrine . <p> Russian officials have n't commented on the attacks on the more sensitive targets . The early warning radars are designed to spot the launch of US missiles to allow Russia to launch its own nuclear-tipped missiles before they are destroyed . <p> James Acton , co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment , said in a recent commentary that Ukrainian attacks on the early warning radars could prompt the Kremlin to think Washington had encouraged such strikes to try to weaken Russia 's nuclear deterrent . <p> " If Moscow believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear forces , its trigger finger could get very itchy , raising the risk that Russia might launch a large-scale nuclear attack based on a false or misinterpreted warning , " Acton said . <p> What changes in the doctrine are under discussion ? <p> The Kremlin 's nuclear threats have been dialed down recently amid Moscow 's battlefield successes in Ukraine . However , there also have been calls in Russia for changing the nuclear doctrine , and Putin said it could be modified , depending on global events . <p> Hawks have called repeatedly for sharpening it , arguing the current document is too weak and vague . They say the doctrine has n't deterred the West from increasing aid to Ukraine and gives the impression that Moscow wo n't ever resort to nuclear weapons . <p> Foreign affairs expert Dmitri Trenin , of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations , a state-funded Moscow think tank , suggests revising it to declare that Russia could strike first with nuclear weapons when " the core national interests are at stake , " like in Ukraine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontation is to prevent NATO 's deeper engagement in it , " Trenin wrote recently . " If we do n't do it , the inertia of persistent escalation by the West will lead to a direct clash between Russian and NATO militaries , which is fraught with a global nuclear war . " <p> At the international forum in St. Petersburg , Sergei Karaganov , a foreign policy expert who advises the Kremlin , also urged Putin to amend the doctrine to lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons . <p> " I hope it will be changed soon to give you the formal right to respond to any strikes on our territory with a nuclear strike , " he told the Russian leader . " I hope that such a provision will be added to our doctrine to help cool our adversaries .

" Let 's remember that rain and try to make humankind come to its senses , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he currently sees no threats that would warrant nuclear weapons use , but he also held the door open to revising the policy . <p> " This doctrine is a living instrument , we are carefully watching what 's going on in the world around us , and we do n't exclude making changes in the doctrine , " he said . <p> The need to modify the document , he said , was driven by concerns about the West pondering the possible deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons . Putin did n't give specifics , but his comments could refer to US discussions on deploying low-power submarine-launched nuclear missiles . <p> Proponents say such weapons are needed to counter Russian threats , while critics argue they could lower the threshold for the US using nuclear weapons and increase the risk of war . <p> " Nuclear devices of extremely low power are being developed , and we are aware of the ideas circulating in expert circles in the West that such strike assets could be used , and there is nothing particularly horrible about it , " Putin said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are taking notice .

There are ways for them to complement one another and bring a whole , cozy chic vibe to your outfits ! Here are tips to prevent the rain from washing away your shine : <h> Wear Dark Colors <p> A good rule of thumb for staying stylish in the rain is to consider whether your outfit will leave you soaked . As a general rule , avoid wearing clothes that are bright since they make raindrops more visible . It is tempting to sashay around in hues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only draw more attention to the trace of rain .

In such situations , layering becomes your reliable ally for adapting to unpredictable weather , whether it 's rain or shine . Lightweight , fitted layers are particularly ideal for pairing with t-shirts and dresses . A cardigan , thin sweater , or a tailored trench coat are great examples of stylish options to layer over your clothes .

On the other hand , shoes made from delicate fabrics are more prone to damage from water exposure . Steer clear of suede or any fabric that does n't handle water well to avoid stains and mishaps while walking . Opt for shoes that repel water , and you 'll keep your feet dry , comfortable , and stylish , no matter how wild the weather gets . <h> Use Waterproof Makeup <p> Of course , your look is n't just about what you wear ; it 's also about what you put on your face .

This means that keeping yourself dry is not enough to maintain your style . A simple and quick-drying hairstyle like a sleek ponytail , clean bun , or a dainty braid goes a long way in protecting your hair . If it ca n't be helped and your hair gets drenched in the rain , dry your hair in the bathroom and tie it back again to keep your look neat . <p> It 's not easy to embrace rainy weather when either style or practicality is compromised .

No response . You start panicking , reading and rereading that message over and over again . You go back to your previous messages -- maybe you missed an underlying tone , maybe they thought you were secretly annoying , maybe you said something confusing . Maybe -- <p> Maybe you just need to breathe . And in most cases , you probably do . It 's easy to jump to conclusions when you 're chatting with friends , especially if you really care about them and are often anxious . If you 're starting to feel a little creature in your head taking control , here are a few ways to alleviate that . <h> 1 . Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into anxiety , one of the best things you can do is directly cut off that train of thought .

Ground yourself so you can move forward with what you should do next , and hopefully make your next decision not in a state of fear or panic . <h> 2 . Remind Yourself That It 's Going To Be OK <p> The brain often can not distinguish between real physical danger and the danger presented in these social situations , and you are most likely not going to be in a perilous situation just because of one bad joke . <p> Do not overthink because real conversations do not just exist in messages , but real connection becomes more authentic if it 's a face-to-face approach . Always imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak in the digital world . Internalize that the resolution of a situation wo n't be as bad as you could imagine , because it will be okay .

Do n't Imagine A " Solution " <p> At this point , you might be tempted to reflect , check all of the messages you have sent before , and try to find a reason why they did n't reply . You could think that the joke was in bad taste , it was a sensitive topic , or they were n't aware of the topic enough . There are a million reasons you could imagine as to why they did n't respond , so you should n't . <p> It 's better not to waste your brain energy trying to figure out the exact reason they did n't respond immediately because you ca n't .

You likely have an idea of their personality , their reactions , their answers to things in life , and their way of talking . As friends , you are probably intimately aware of how they converse and interact . <p> Based on that , you probably know that they 're kind , caring , and understanding . They 're likely the type of people who will chuckle at a dumb joke or understand when someone misspeaks . After all , there is a reason why you 're friends with them , right ? <p> This is a big anxiety boulder of a problem to untangle , but it goes a long way to help solve any future worries you have about such messages .

Anxiety can be a difficult thing to overcome , but with time , it can be a beast that 's a little bit less threatening every time you see it . <p> It can be debilitating to worry about every single text message you send , but hopefully , with time , you learn to lessen the fear of doing so .

@@112025233 <p> The past few weeks have seen several e-newspaper articles on the thoughts of several stakeholders in Philippine development . Most of the articles are about the challenges , difficulties , and issues on improving Philippine education as a result of our low ranking on creative thinking in a global assessment report . <p> The ideas on new approaches to development and public management are very good recommendations . American thinker Paul Romer , who was awarded a Nobel Prize in economics , shares the New Growth Theory or the belief that knowledge contributes to growth and development while creating new services to benefit more individuals . But we need to first improve our fundamental reading comprehension before we can generate and accumulate knowledge . <p> Improving Philippine education is a continuing concern . An immediate and interesting initiative is to revisit the wisdom of ancient philosophers in Greece , where the practice of reflecting on , and asking related and follow-up questions were ways to learn . These ways are significantly more effective than the conventional way of learning through rote memorization . Such reflection and questions encouraged a sense of inquisitiveness or curiosity , and paved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or school called Akademie . <p> There are also existing teaching approaches , methods , techniques , and tools from intellectual thinkers in education , psychology , and other learning sciences that are available in most classic literature .

This idea gives importance to " otherness " or caring for others , an important factor needed to create a better society . In relation to " otherness " is the general sentiment that we must also live to serve the greater good rather than celebrate and romanticize our job title or position with its attached fame or popularity . <p> Another valuable but less known or overlooked idea for Philippine development is the worldview in the social sciences , or how we put into perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative view of living a modest life focused on spirituality , simplicity , learning , and kindness or caring for others . This way of living allows us to make decisions and actions for the greater good , and do what is good and right even without anyone seeing what we are doing . It keeps us from focusing too much on ourselves and on instant rewards or gratification . <p> City-states , societies , or countries that demonstrate this view include Bhutan , which focuses its national initiatives on gross national happiness that cares more about the welfare of its people and the environment rather than financial gains . There 's also Finland , which is admired for having the best educational system in the world , being consistent in having a very high ranking in the human development index or quality of life , and is known for its " Sisu " or national character of determination , courage , and resilience . <p> If we look closely and analyze these ideas , or if we apply the creativity of Steve Jobs which is the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd realize that the core or root of development depends on the way people in an environment think ( cognitive ) and the way people behave and act ( affective ) . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> In essence , we must believe that it is important to tweak our worldview so that instead of aiming to achieve a better me or a better you , we 'd transcend that goal and would now think , behave , and act for the greater good or " a better us.

@@112495230 <h> Table of Contents Hide <p> Vice President Kamala Harris has replaced President Joe Biden atop the presidential ticket , but his " finish the job " campaign mantra can still largely apply to her top policy goals . She 's promising to continue a lot of what Biden was doing during the past four years if she 's elected to four of her own . <p> Former President Donald Trump , for his part , is itching to get back to the White House and accomplish what he did n't during his first term . <p> Since Biden stepped down last month , the vice president has announced few major policy proposals beyond a new push to prevent price gouging by food producers and grocers and plans to cut taxes for families , attempt to bring down homebuying and rental prices and reduce medical debt . Harris also used a recent rally in Las Vegas , where the economy runs on the hospitality industry , to call for ending taxes on tips paid to restaurant , hotel and other service employees . That came more than a month after Trump used his own Las Vegas rally to promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifics on policy , the vice president has committed generally to some major policy positions on various matters , promising to sign sweeping legislation that 's unlikely to clear Congress . <p> While details are still rather vague , there 's no doubt that whoever prevails in November will seek to shape the landscape of American life in ways wholly distinct from their opponent . <p> On nearly every issue , the choices -- if the winner gets his or her way -- are sharply defined . <p> The onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change , or a slow walk if not an about-face . Higher taxes on the super rich , or cuts to benefit high-wage earners . Abortion rights reaffirmed , or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides . Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country , or massive deportations . A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go . <p> Here 's where each candidate stands on 10 top issues : <h> Abortion <p> HARRIS : The vice president has called on Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right that stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court . Like Biden , Harris has criticized bans on abortion in Republican-controlled states and promised as president to block any potential nationwide ban should one clear a future GOP-run Congress . Harris was the Democrats ' most visible champion of abortion rights even while Biden was still in the race . She has promoted the administration 's efforts short of federal law -- including steps to protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records . <p> TRUMP : The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade , ending the constitutional right to an abortion . After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted , Trump announced last spring that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states . He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law . But he 's declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies . <h> Climate/Energy <p> HARRIS : As a senator from California , the vice president was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal , a sweeping series of proposals meant to swiftly move the U.S. to fully green energy that is championed by the Democratic Party 's most progressive wing . Harris also said during her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign that she opposed offshore drilling for oil and hydraulic fracturing . But during her three and a half years as vice president , Harris has adopted more moderate positions , focusing instead on implementing the climate provisions of the Biden administration 's Inflation Reduction Act . That provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects . The Biden administration has also enlisted more than 20,000 young people in a national " Climate Corps , " a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands . Despite that , it 's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half by 2030 -- a benchmark that Harris has n't talked about in the early part of her own White House bid . <p> TRUMP : His mantra for one of his top policy priorities : " DRILL , BABY , DRILL . " Trump , who in the past cast climate change as a " hoax " and harbors a particular disdain for wind power , says it 's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world . He 'd increase oil drilling on public lands , offer tax breaks to oil , gas and coal producers , speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration 's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars , which he argues have a place but should n't be forced on consumers . He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords , end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs , stoves , dishwashers and shower heads . <h> Democracy/Rule of Law <p> HARRIS : Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's democracy . But , in attacking her opponent , the vice president has leaned more heavily into her personal background as a prosecutor and contrasted that with Trump being found guilty of 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case and in being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court . The vice president has also talked less frequently than Biden did about Trump 's denial that he lost the 2020 presidential election and his spurring on the Jan. 6 , 2021 , assault on the Capitol . When she 's interrupted during rallies with supporters ' " lock him up " chants directed at Trump , Harris responds that the courts can " handle that " and " our job is to beat him in November . " <p> TRUMP : After refusing to accept his loss to Biden in 2020 , Trump has n't committed to accepting the results this time . He 's repeatedly promised to pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol .

She is also part of an administration that is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur . In April , the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees , thus making them easier to dismiss . That was in response to Schedule F , a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The former president has sought to distance himself from " Project 2025 , " despite his close ties to many of its key architects .

" The former president plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections . He says he 'd then move to fire " rogue bureaucrats , " including those who " weaponized our justice system , " and the " warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State , the Pentagon , the State Department , and the national security industrial complex . " Trump has also pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission . <h> Immigration <p> HARRIS : Attempting to defuse a GOP line of political attack , the vice president has talked up her experience as California attorney general , saying she walked drug smuggler tunnels and successfully prosecuted gangs that moved narcotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Biden made Harris his administration 's point person on the root causes of migration . Trump and top Republicans now blame Harris for a situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that they say is out of control due to policies that were too lenient . Harris has attempted to counter that by arguing that a bipartisan Senate compromise that would have included tougher asylum standards and hiring more border agents , immigration judges and asylum officers was poised to clear Congress before Trump came out in opposition to it . Harris now says that Trump " talks the talk , but does n't walk the walk " on immigration . The vice president has endorsed comprehensive immigration reform , seeking pathways to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status , with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who arrived as children . <p> TRUMP : The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history -- an operation that could involve detention camps and the National Guard .

" He 'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor " jihadist sympathies . " He 'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally . <h> Israel/Gaza <p> HARRIS : Harris says Israel has a right to defend itself , and she 's repeatedly decried Hamas as a terrorist organization . But the vice president might also have helped defuse some backlash from progressives by being more vocal about the need to better protect civilians during fighting in Gaza , where the civilian death toll has now exceeded 40,000 .

" She leads audiences in chants of " We 're not going back . " While her campaign has yet to produce specifics on its plans , she 's been part of a Biden administration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early in Biden 's term , his administration reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service , and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX , the 1972 law that was passed to protect women 's rights , also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity . That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes . <p> TRUMP : The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women 's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that " only two genders , " as determined at birth , are recognized by the United States . He promises to " defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology . " As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care , he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the " chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth " no longer meets federal health and safety standards and wo n't get federal money . He 'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wrong body . " Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service . <h> NATO/Ukraine <p> HARRIS : The vice president has yet to specify how her positions on Russia 's war with Ukraine might differ from Biden 's , other than to praise the president 's efforts to rebuild alliances unraveled by Trump , particularly NATO , a critical bulwark against Russian aggression . The Biden administration has pledged unceasing support for Ukraine against Russia 's invasion . The government has sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine , including a tranche of aid that totaled $61 billion in weapons , ammunition and other assistance that is expected to last through the end of this year . The administration has maintained that continuing U.S. assistance is critical because Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine . Harris has said previously that it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin 's " brutality . " <p> TRUMP : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine and says he will continue to " fundamentally reevaluate " the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office . He has claimed , without explanation , that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table . ( His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire . ) On NATO , he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets . Trump drew alarms this year when he said that , as president , he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that do n't hit those targets , but " would encourage " Russia " to do whatever the hell they want " to countries that are " delinquent . " <h> Tariffs/Trade <p> HARRIS : Though she was critical of free trade deals before becoming vice president , Harris has more recently offered no signs that she 'll oppose Biden 's policies . That might mean adhering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , endorsed a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel , a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports . In May , the Biden-Harris administration said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5% . Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan 's Nippon Steel , because it is " vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated . " <p> TRUMP : The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs on nearly all imported foreign goods , saying that " we 're going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years . " Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices . He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China . Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy , technology and farmland . Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one , they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation . <h> Taxes <p> HARRIS : The vice president has promised to work with state entities to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million qualifying Americans and plans to push Congress to make permanent a $3,600 per child tax credit approved through 2025 for eligible families . She also wants to offer a new $6,000 tax credit for those with newborn children , and cut taxes for frontline workers and on healthcare plans offered on the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act . Harris says her administration will expand tax credits for first-time homebuyers and push to build 3 million new housing units in four years , while wiping out taxes on tips and endorsing steeper taxes on corporations . That last part mirrors Biden , who proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness " that will bring in more money to invest in Americans . The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum , raised under the Inflation Reduction Act , is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year . Harris has called for restoring the child tax credit that was enacted under the 2021 COVID-19 relief package , but has since expired . <p> TRUMP : The former president has promised to extend the 2017 tax cuts that he signed into law and are set to expire at the end of 2025 . That package cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit . Those elements will remain until and unless a new law changes them , but many other tax cuts in Trump 's package will lapse without further action by Congress . Trump says he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further -- to as low as 15% -- and repeal any tax increases that occurred under Biden .

From not knowing a lot , he can now converse with people about satellites without needing to look at his notes . <p> " The growth was really exponential , " he said . " The program was designed for you to learn a lot . " <p> Maya-3 and Maya-4 both reentered the Earth 's atmosphere in 2022 . <h> Mentorship is a two-way street <p> In contrast to Wee , Maya-7 engineer John Michael Rey Zamora had been following PhilSA 's activities since the agency 's establishment in 2019 . He graduated from the Southern Luzon State University in Quezon province with an electronics and communications engineering degree in 2018 and had been meaning to apply then . <p> ( After I passed the board exam , the STAMINA4Space applications had just closed . So , I thought to myself : maybe it 's not my time yet . ) <p> And so , Zamora first worked for the local private industry for three-and-a-half years . But in 2022 , he came across PhilSA 's call for applications for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies Nanosat ) project . The project continued the cube satellite program , which began under the DOST . <p> Zamora applied and has since been working with seven other team members on the Maya-7 , while taking the nanosatellite engineering track under a master of science or master of engineering in electrical engineering course at UP Diliman . <p> But as the project was just beginning , a challenge already presented itself to the team : it turned out that the Maya-7 satellite would be a two-unit cube satellite -- two cube satellites stacked on top of each other . This means that the Maya-7 team would have to approach the project differently from the past teams who worked on Maya satellites . <p> The team is fortunate to have a lot of PhilSA engineers with prior experience mentoring them . Aside from Wee , other PhilSA engineers who worked on the Maya , Diwata , and MULA satellites have been offering their ideas to the team . PhilSA and Maya-1 engineer Adrian Salces is currently leading the entire project . <p> However , this proved to be another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the project : among the sea of ideas , they had to figure out the best approach . <p> ( There were different philosophies , approaches , and perspectives on how to do things . It was very confusing at first . ) <p> But having different perspectives is healthy when it comes to building a satellite . <p> " I understand the confusion because when you 're learning , even when you read different books , the books will give you different examples and perspectives , " Wee said in a mix of English and Filipino . <p> With the new ideas and concepts , the Maya-7 team eventually integrated their mentors ' best practices as they built the two-unit cube satellite . <p> " The good thing actually in mentoring : it 's not really a one-way street , it 's a two way street . Because , of course , the mentees have experiences of their own . " Wee said in a mix of English and Filipino . <p> As for Salces , being a mentor does n't mean being perfect . " The mentees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You just have to listen . " <p> The Maya-7 team is currently working on building the engineering model of the Maya-7 satellite . The engineering model would be exactly the same as the satellite model to be flown into space , but it 's meant to go through tests to check if the satellite would work based on the team 's design . <p> The team has yet to build the flight model that would be launched into space . <h> Patience is a virtue <p> Salces , like Wee , never really planned on becoming a space engineer . <p> He was a graduate student and faculty member of the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute at UP Diliman from 2014 to 2016 . At the time , he was inspired by his mentor and thesis adviser , now-PhilSA Director General Joel Joseph Marciano Jr. , to pursue space engineering . <p> So , in 2016 , he took the opportunity to build the first Maya satellite under Kyutech 's Joint Global Multi-Nation Birds Project while taking a doctoral in space engineering in Japan . Two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite returned to Earth in 2020 after two years in orbit . In the same year , Salces returned to the Philippines after finishing his doctoral studies . <p> " When I returned in 2020 , I thought it would be best to use what I learned and the experiences I gained to lead another satellite project locally . That 's when I started with PhilSA , " he said . <p> However , he had a difficult time applying what he learned to the Maya-7 satellite project . Back in Japan , he was used to easily getting components , making the satellite-building process fast . In the Philippines , manufacturing companies are not yet fully equipped to produce satellite and spacecraft components . <p> The Maya-7 team has been working with these companies to produce such components . This effort has been part of PhilSA 's bigger goal of strengthening the country 's space industry . <p> As of this writing , some components for Maya-7 from local manufacturers have not yet arrived . The team has solved this issue by having the missing components 3D-printed to proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team a feel of assembling the components of the satellite , which is a sensitive and critical process .

I have been that guy for 42 years now . I know there are better , younger , better-looking singers than me , but I stay true to myself and the music I am known for .

That 's the magic behind that song . <p> But one day , years later when my life was a wreck with me living alone in my studio office and sleeping under my desk on a thin mattress , wondering when I would work again , I get a knock on the door . <p> In my boxer shorts and no shirt , I answer the door and there 's a man who hands me papers , pats me on the shoulder after saying , " You have been served !

It also cited " overpriced rentals " for the OVP 's satellite offices , " near-expired " food items intended as aid , and the dismally low disbursement of funds for its flagship livelihood project . <p> Duterte could have explained the OVP 's expenditures if she had attended the budget hearings and could have given " better answers , better justifications " for them to the House members . <p> " But to my mind , it would not have changed anything . This would have still been the decision of the committee , " Quimbo said . <h> First to exceed P1B <p> If the cuts were approved , the new OVP budget would amount to about the same as its 2022 budget under then Vice President Leni Robredo . <p> It was only under Duterte that the budget for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2023 , despite criticisms that it did not need that much money considering the Vice President 's constitutional mandate of taking over the presidency if the President of the republic is unable to perform the job due to death or removal through impeachment . <p> Quimbo stressed , however , that the budget cuts were not final and merely recommendations to be taken up in plenary debates beginning Sept.16 . <p> Quimbo said House members were hoping to approve the General Appropriations Bill on third reading by Sept. 25 .

@@114077230 <h> ANALYSIS How should the Global South look at the US elections ? <p> This is AI generated summarization , which may have errors . For context , always refer to the full article . <p> Democratic Party progressives have less than two months before election day to organize and prove that a Harris presidency would represent less of a threat to the interests of the Global South than the Trump-Vance gang <p> As the US elections come closer , there is growing pressure on many progressives in the Global South to make our voices heard in support of the candidacy of Kamala Harris . No act on your part is insignificant in these elections , we are told . The votes of your relatives in the US could spell the difference in a very tight race . <p> The argument is fairly straightforward . Donald Trump is a threat to democracy in the US and to the interests of the Global South as well . Harris and the Democrats may have their flaws , but the alternative , four years of Donald Trump , is worse . <p> Past Democratic administrations , the argument continues , may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wall Street and Big Tech , and make more progress in promoting the rights of minorities , but under the Democrats , there is at least the space to debate these failures and correct them , racism will not be given a free pass , the climate crisis will be given the urgent attention it requires , and fundamental democratic norms like majority rule in electoral contests will not be brazenly violated . Trump in power is very likely to push hard to bring the United States to the brink of authoritarian rule , if not fascism , and informally his administration 's ruling ideology will be unbridled White Supremacy . <p> How would I respond to this proposition ? First of all , it 's fine to make an analytical or ethical judgment on two competing political positions , but I would consider it unwise to actively intervene in the politics of a foreign country . Secondly , I have no quarrel with the assessment that a Harris victory would be in the interest of the majority of people in the United States ; it is the claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South than a Trump regime that I find questionable and worth an extended discussion . <h> Two parties of Empire <p> Both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have favored an expansive imperialism that has extended US corporate hegemony by force of arms . Both have mobilized the ideology of missionary democracy , or spreading the gospel of western democracy in what they consider the benighted non-western world , to legitimize imperial expansion . And at certain historical moments , like during the debate to invade Afghanistan in 2001 , both have manipulated democratic hysteria to advance the ends of empire . <p> The record speaks for itself . To take just the most recent examples , only one Democratic member of Congress , Barbara Lee , voted against the resolution authorizing the invasion of Afghanistan . Despite the absence of evidence that Saddam Hussein possessed nuclear weapons , the majority of Democratic Senators voted to commit US troops to the invasion of Iraq in 2002 . And it was a Democratic president , Barack Obama , that led the campaign that , in brazen violation of the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2011 , leading eventually to the state of anarchy that has prevailed since then in that country . <p> Of course , there have been some variations in the ways Democrats and Republicans have conducted their empire-building or empire-maintaining activities . Democrats have tended to be more " multilateral " in their approach . They have , in other words , invested more effort in marshalling the United Nations and NATO behind Washington 's imperial adventures than Republicans . They have also pushed the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to take the lead in economically disciplining countries of the global South . But the aim is simply to provide the US 's moves with more legitimacy than would a unilateral exercise of US power , that is , clothe the iron fist with a velvet glove . These are differences of style that are minor and marginal in terms of their consequences . <p> Critics from the Global South have rightly pointed out that Obama 's elimination of Quaddafi with the approval of the United Nations Security Council may have had more " legitimacy " than Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Willing , but the results have been the same : the overthrow via an exercise , largely of US power , of a legitimate government and the consequent disintegration of a society . <h> The great Republican exodus <p> Over the last few months , however , there has been an interesting phenomenon . More and more people who played key foreign policy roles in previous Republican administrations have declared their support for the Democratic candidate , first Joe Biden , now Kamala Harris . The most notable recent addition to the Democratic bandwagon is former Vice President Dick Cheney , who was one of the key architects of Bush Jr 's interventionist wars in the Middle East , who recently signed up along with daughter Liz . More are expected to defect in the less than two months remaining before the elections . <p> There are two reasons why former foreign policy hardliners have been leaving the Republican fold . The first is that they can no longer trust Trump , who now has total control of the Republican base . In their view , Trump during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last seventy eight years by speaking badly of allies and demanding they pay for US protection , declaring the Republican-sponsored invasion of Iraq a mistake , and crossing red lines that the US Cold War elite put in place , the most famous being his stepping across the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) in Korea to talk to Kim Jong Un . More recently , he has repeatedly suggested disapproval of US and NATO support for Ukraine in its war with Russia , while his running mate JD Vance , wants to eliminate aid to Kyiv altogether . <p> Trump , these Republican deserters feel , is not interested in sticking to the cornerstone of the bipartisan consensus that the US elite , despite their sometimes rancorous quarrels , have adhered to : expanding and maintaining a " liberal " empire via free trade and the free flow of capital -- an order promoted by political canopy of multilateralism , legitimized via an economic ideology of globalization and a political ideology of liberal democracy , and defended by a western military alliance at the center of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the not insignificant part of his base , personified by Vance , that is tired of bearing the costs of empire and see this as one of the key causes of America 's economic decline . They know that what makes " Make America Great Again " ( MAGA ) attractive to many people is its promise to build a Fortress America that is much , much less engaged with the world and focused on rebuilding the imperial heartland . They are apprehensive that under Trump , the multilateral institutions through which the US has exercised its power , NATO and the Bretton Woods institutions , would be allowed to wither away . They fear that selective , pragmatic deal-making , like the one Trump tried with Kim Jong-Un , Xi Jin Ping , and Vladimir Putin , would , instead , become the norm in US diplomacy and unilateral military action rather than allied initiatives via NATO would be the principal means to coerce and discipline the Global South . <p> The other reason hardline Republicans are engaging in the once despised practice of crossing party lines is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive militarized foreign policy once associated with the Bush Jr administration in the Middle East in the 2000 's . Biden has given full-throated support to Israel , which the hard-line Republicans have sanctified as the only reliable ally in the Middle East , followed Bush Jr 's policy of isolating Russia by supporting Ukraine , reinvigorated NATO after Trump 's morale-sapping bad-mouthing of US allies and expanded the alliance 's reach to the Pacific , and mounted the full-blown containment of China that Bush Jr and Cheney wanted to carry out but had to shelve owing to their need to win 's Beijing 's participation in their administration 's " war on terror . " <p> Biden has , in fact , taken the containment of Beijing beyond Trump 's approach of curtailing trade and technology transfers by carrying out the aggressive military encirclement of China . He has done what no other American president had done since the historic 1979 Joint Communique articulating Washington 's " One China Policy , " which is to explicitly commit Washington to a military defense of Taiwan . He has ordered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bait Beijing and deployed five of the US 's 11 carrier task forces to the Western Pacific . Not surprisingly , his gestures have given the green light to worrisome bellicose rhetoric from the top military brass , like the statement of Gen Mike Minihan , chief of the US Air Mobility Command , that , " My gut tells me we will fight in 2025 . " <p> That the Democratic party elite now has a monopoly of promoting expansive imperialism was in full display during Kamala Harris 's acceptance speech during the Democratic National Convention on August 23 , when she accused Trump of abdicating American gobal leadership , seeking to abandon NATO , and encouraging " Putin to invade our allies " and " do whatever the hell they want . " Republican defectors like Cheney and daughter Liz could only cheer when Harris promised to make sure the US armed forces would be " the most lethal fighting force in the world " and committed herself to making sure " that America , not China , wins the competition for the 21st century . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contention on November 5 are two paradigms of empire . <p> One is the old Democratic/Republican expansionist vision of empire that seeks to make the world safe for American capital and American hegemony . The opposing view , that of Trump and JD Vance , his vice presidential pick , considers the empire overextended and proposes an " aggressive defensive " posture appropriate to a superpower in decline . The MAGA approach would disengage from what Trump has called " shithole countries " -- meaning most of us in the Global South -- and focus more on walling off the core of the empire , North America , from the outside world by radically restricting migration and trade , bringing prodigal American capital back , dispensing with what Trump considers the hypocritical exercise of extending foreign aid and exporting democracy , and abandoning with a vengeance all efforts to address the accelerating global climate crisis ( preoccupation with which he considers a fetish of effete liberalism ) . <p> As far as the exercise of force is concerned , the MAGA approach would most likely be in the Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall to keep them off balance , without consulting any allies or giving a damn for whatever havoc they cause . <p> If these are what are on offer in the November 5 elections , then it would be foolish for us in the Global South to take sides since both paradigms are detrimental to our interests . <h> From helpless hostages to decisive actors <p> Still , some say , you have to cut the Democrats some slack . <p> In terms of their composition , Democrats and the Republicans are not , strictly speaking , twin sides of the same imperial coin . Owing to the constraints of the US electoral system , there is a large contingent of progressives whose only political home is the Democratic Party . In terms of values , these folks are our allies . They have more in common with us than with their party 's elite , and they have been , for the most part , ignored and taken for granted by the latter , whose attitude towards them can be summed up as " You have no choice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the problem is that , so far , most of these progressive Democratic supporters have passively accepted Harris ' and the party elite 's imperial rhetoric and gestures , like Harris ' refusal to grant the rather modest request of giving a pro-Palestinian Democrat a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention <p> My sense is that the progressive bloc in the Democratic Party probably underestimate their strength . In the circumstances surrounding these elections in particular , they can transform themselves from helpless hostages to awful policies to significant actors that can force Harris and the party elite to think twice or thrice about embracing the rabidly imperialist platform that Harris enunciated at the convention -- but only if they 're bold enough to act on their convictions , like Rep Barbara Lee did in casting the sole dissenting vote against the war in Afghanistan , an act of great courage that history has vindicated . <p> Progressive Democrats should realize that the only way to get the party elite to listen and change tack is to organize themselves and like-minded voters to abstain from voting if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a tight race , could effectively throw the elections to Trump . If I understand it correctly , this was the approach that the Uncommitted Movement from Michigan originally planned to follow to force Biden to reverse his pro-genocide policy in Gaza . This strategy is risky , but it can work if the party elite gets the message that the progressives are determined to carry out their threat . Fortune has never rewarded the timid . This is the only way to get the party elite to begin to change course . Otherwise they will act like they 've always acted , from Clinton to Obama to Biden , which is to take your support for granted and run over you . <p> Democratic Party progressives have less than two months to go till election day to organize and prove that a Harris presidency would represent less of a threat to the interests of the Global South than the Trump-Vance gang . And even if they succeed in getting Harris to retreat from her bellicose imperial threats , we in the Global South would be well advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empire . -- Rappler.com <p> Walden Bello is co-chair of the Board of Focus on the Global South that is affiliated with the Chulalongkorn University Social Research Institute , and a member of the International Council of Progressive International .

Parole board members should remember what happened on October 25 , 1994 , and review her prison records , including incidents of misconduct . <p> Thirty years ago , Smith buckled her two sons -- three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander -- into her Mazda , drove to John D. Long Lake and placed the car in neutral so it would roll into the water .

Smith thought her fabricated story of a carjacking would stick with the authorities , believing the police would never locate the car submerged 122 feet from the shore . <p> Beyond her ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in a state with capital punishment , is troubling . She was focused on achieving her goal -- a comfortable life with her relatively affluent lover in a small South Carolina town . <p> The manner of the murder adds another layer of horror . Smith freed herself from the sinking car but intentionally left her two young boys strapped in their seats . That a mother could do so callously gives a haunting picture of a woman devoid of conscience and empathy . <p> We will never know what Michael and Alex may have said in those last moments , but it 's harrowing to imagine the terror and helplessness they experienced before their deaths . Hours later , Smith made dramatic pleas to law enforcement and the media . <p> " To my babies , your mama loves you so much , and your daddy and his whole family loves you so much , and you guys have got to be strong . Whoever has my children , that they please , I mean please , bring them home , " Smith said at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bodies of Michael and Alex still strapped in their seats . Smith became one of the most notorious child murderers in US history , and now she will face her first parole hearing in 30 years . <p> Smith has little to offer the parole board , no good behavior , and no contrition for her crime . <p> In 2015 , 20 years after the murder , she wrote to reporters : " I am not the monster society thinks I am . I am far from it . Something went very wrong that night . I was not myself . I was a good mother , and I loved my boys . The thing that hurts me the most is that people think I hurt my children in order to be with a man . That is so far from the truth .

Haines made a similar offer to Rwandan President Paul Kagame during a trip to Kigali , which US and United Nations officials say backs M23 . Those meetings initiated what is now almost a year of rare intelligence sharing with both sides , according to senior US officials , who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive negotiations .

Wizard Production asserted that Seunghan decided to leave <p> In light of this , Seunghan penned a handwritten letter addressed to RIIZE fans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that he was aware of the seriousness of the situation surrounding his return to RIIZE and what that may entail for his members and the company .

To give us all Filipinos lead time to plan ahead on where to spend our non-working days with our families , Malaca ? ang Palace released last week the list of official holidays and other special non-working holidays for 2025 . After all , this will promote the " holiday economics " as a policy that President Ferdinand " Bongbong " Marcos Jr . ( PBBM ) reinstituted in our country . <p> The holiday economics became a government policy in 2007 when then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Republic Act ( RA ) 9492 , allowing the Chief Executive to move holidays that fall on a Wednesday or Sunday to the closest Monday . While this had become acceptable to most sectors , workers who are not permanently employed who fall under the labor laws on no-work , no-pay were not happy about it . Thus , the holiday economics policy was scrapped after the late president Benigno Simeon " Noynoy " Aquino III assumed office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 , former president Rodrigo Duterte signed a proclamation declaring fewer non-working days in 2021 supposedly to boost the economy that hit negative growth due to lockdowns . In his Proclamation , Nov. 2 ( All Souls ' Day ) , Dec. 24 ( Christmas Eve ) and Dec. 31 ( New Year 's Eve ) , which had been special holidays in the past , were declared as special working days . " For the country to recover from the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic , there is a need to encourage economic productivity by , among others , minimizing work disruption and commemorating some special holidays as special ( working ) days instead , " the Duterte proclamation stated . <p> In 2022 , PBBM reintroduced holiday economics when he issued Proclamation 90 that declared the regular holidays and special non-working days for 2023 . Issued on Nov. 11 , 2022 , PBBM 's proclamation likewise invoked the need to boost the domestic tourism industry that was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns . <p> Under Proclamation No. 727 signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President " issued last week , the regular holidays for 2025 included the anniversary of the EDSA People Power Revolution on Feb. 25 which falls on a Tuesday next year . The 38th anniversary of the EDSA Revolution was not included in the list of this year 's holidays . Malaca ? ang explained its exclusion was because the date fell on a Sunday . <p> Also , the assassination of the late senator Benigno " Ninoy " Aquino ( Aug. 21 ) , which will fall on a Thursday , is among the " special non-working days " for 2025 . Incidentally , PBBM issued a separate Proclamation No. 729 that declared July 27 , 2025 , the founding anniversary of Iglesia ni Cristo ( INC ) , as a " special non-working day " nationwide . <p> While the Philippines struggles to get a large chunk of the global tourism and travel market , holiday economics provide the much-needed shot in the arm from our own people , who are encouraged to visit our own country .

But no worries . There are a lot of automated teller machines ( ATMs ) available to withdraw cash from our bank accounts . The only problem is when an ATM conks out due to a glitch , or its dispenser runs out of cash due to heavy withdrawals . <p> If an ATM conks out , a depositor can use another bank 's ATM terminal . But when a bank suffers " off-line " glitch , then it becomes a problem because all ATM terminals of that bank can not be accessed . Still , there is a solution because all Philippine banks are connected through inter-bank ATM transactions , either MegaLink or BancNet . But if you use another bank 's ATM terminal to withdraw cash , be ready to pay fees or charges for specific transactions . <p> Once the ATM processes it , a transaction fee of P18 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use other ATM networks in the Philippines , transaction limit is P10,000 -- although some banks allow as high as P20,000 maximum withdrawal per transaction . But all of them impose " corresponding charges " or transactions fees that banks collect from non-depositors using their ATM terminal . <p> Imagine the dismay of a recipient of the government 's monthly cash subsidy , popularly called " ayuda , " that may soon be downloaded in ATMs . Checking at the ATM if the P500 " ayuda " is already deposited to his bank account , he is charged automatically a P2 transaction fee for balance inquiry . <p> For a Juan dela Cruz depositor , whether it 's P2 or P18 per transaction , the fee is too much of a deduction . Such a transaction fee hurts a lot the pockets of small depositors . <p> This is not to mention these banks automatically deduct 20 percent withholding income tax on interest earnings on our savings deposits . <p> No wonder banks make a lot of money even during COVID-19 pandemic and disasters and crises . Like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite being their own customers . Know-your-client and abuse them . <p> But the most usury-like transaction fee is the " cash-in " being now a popular mobile electric wallet service . It offers and allows subscribers/users to send and receive money , pay bills , buy load and shop online . It also offers a variety of other features , such as investment products and borrowing cash or emergency loans . <p> One e-wallet service provider charges as much as two percent transaction fee on cash-ins that exceed the monthly limit of P8,000 . So if you are supposed to receive P10,000 , you will get only P9,702 because P198.00 was automatically deducted from your cash-in . <p> And yet all these banks and financial institutions have been digitalized supposedly to make transactions less costly but more convenient , efficient and fast . But obviously , the banks and other financial intermediaries are only too eager to pass on the cost of digitalization to their consumers and customers . <p> The best of the best in Cebu chess will try to outdo each other in the Cebu Executives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8th Engr .

@@117539232 <p> " Some of you may or may not have already heard of this but I have requested for JoeyG to stop singing ' Forevermore , ' unless he sings it with Side A. I just want to clarify that this was a personal decision I made alone , and not by Side A or any of its members , past or present . <p> " I reached out to JoeyG and his management to express my concern that his solo performances of Side A songs , particularly ' Forevermore , ' were causing confusion among the audience regarding the identity of Side A. <p> " Just to give you some context , when Joey G went solo in 2015 , he had a concert at the Music Museum and invited me as one of the guests , which I happily supported . Flew from Silay , Negros Occidental to support my bandmate , roommate when we tour , my kumpare , my dear friend . Sure why not , all support . <p> " However , napansin ko that many of the songs he performed were still from Side A repertoire , including the band 's banner song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have an effect on the current Side A 's career . <p> " And so , I talked to him and encouraged him to co-write with other songwriters , work with arrangers para makatulong sa kanya in establishing his own identity . <p> " Because I truly believe kayang kaya niya naman to go solo , especially since he has such a beautiful , distinct voice . Who would n't love JoeyG 's voice ? He can sing anything and make it sound good . <p> " My interactions with JoeyG have been nothing but friendly , almost familial ... years of performing together and growing together made our friendship so deep , di maipagkakaila na para na kaming naging pamilya . <p> " So I continued to encourage him to establish a name for himself , moving away from songs ( that use arrangements of our originals and remakes that we arranged , produced and recorded as a band ) that keep him tethered to Side A. <p> " I do n't mean for him to completely cut ties with the band , not at all ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do believe this to be best and fair to both him building a solo career and for the band to move on successfully without him . <p> " Alam niyo , what you hear in a published song is just the tip of the iceberg . Beneath the surface lies a massive amount of hardwork , effort in making a song , composing , producing , recording , and the extensive amount of arranging and re-arranging that transforms a demo song into a final product . <p> " And every member of the band contributes to every sound created , all in an effort to deliver the songs to our listeners with excellence . <p> " I remember when I was with Side A ( 1985-2007 ) we never released a song without careful consideration . Every line sung , every guitar riff , every drum pattern , etc was meticulously crafted . Sometimes , or a lot of times , sobra na nga , halos hindi na kami natutulog . <p> " Naldy and I went overboard i think ... but that 's what defines that Side A sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our standards . While there were times our judgment was n't perfect , the band has always been committed to making every song with excellence . <p> " I know that even with the current members , that same passion and dedication remains . As I often say , as long as Naldy ( Gonzalez ) is with Side A , that excellent sound that we all love will always remain . <p> " My point is , what people hear is a finish product of a well-crafted song that was birthed out of passion , dedication and hardwork by the whole band . The lead vocalist understandably usually gets a lot of the credit but that 's totally okay with all of us ; that 's part of being in a band . When one gets the credit , we all feel good because we know we all contributed to it . <p> " And while on one hand , it is always deeply humbling and gratifying for one 's songs to be interpreted and recorded/performed by other artists , and on another , I am also supportive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been and always will be proud of and protective of Side A. <p> " So when it came to my attention that such songs that the whole band worked hard for were benefiting one but also unfairly taking away from the band -- and have been clearly affecting the band though they themselves have remained silent about it , kept their peace , not making trouble , sometimes sila pa ang napapasama , even though in a way , I feel they are the ones being taken advantage of -- I had to somehow find a way to lend a hand . <p> " Which brings me to my decision with ' Forevermore , ' in particular . A song , inspired by my wife , and written for Side A , and as long as Side A exists , it will remain a Side A song . <p> " I know this is a bit long , but I wanted to make people aware that this was a decision I did not make lightly or hastily . And that the people involved are all important to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen out of this ? I would say .... <p> " First , I hope that JoeyG will have a good solo carreer that would not affect Side A , meaning he will be known to have his own songs as JoeyG and not singing Side A songs . ( Parang Steve Perry na nagka Foolish Heart after Journey ) Note : When Steve Perry left Journey , he did n't sing or perform any Journey songs , even with the songs he co-wrote with the band . ) <p> " Second , that Joey G and Side A would get to settle their differences and be reconciled . <p> " Third , that all of the members of Side A will be on one stage someday performing and creating that wonderful music that God has gifted all of us , " ang kabuuang pahayag ni Joey Benin . <p> Disclaimer : The comments uploaded on this site do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of management and owner of Bandera .

Tom Parker 's near-absolute control over his talent as well as highlighting the fact that the King once performed in pink , one wonders whether the documentary feature " Return of the King : The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley " has anything more to say about him . <p> Given the laughable conspiracy theory that Presley was an FBI spy for the government who faked his death in 1977 and still dwells among us , what more can be said ? <p> Directed by Jason Hehir ( " Andre the Giant , " " The Last Dance " miniseries on the Chicago Bulls ) , the Netflix original " Return of the King " tries to convey that what matters is how you tell the Elvis story . It is n't so much a rehashed biography of the touted King of Rock and Roll as it is a tweaking of known events and facts to pursue a clever suspense angle : Will the King , with this 1968 television special , be successfully restored to the spotlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded that in the pre-cable/digital era , free television was much more powerful . A hit TV program then could have a greater public impact than a viral video today . The public 's reaction to a bad or good TV show on primetime in the sixties spelled the difference between a performer 's make and break , or in this case , more Elvis and no more Elvis . <p> Presley , donning a black leather outfit , is shown at the start of the docu fumbling and hesitating during a recording of his performance before a live audience . From this awkward moment , we rewind to the King 's earlier years , in which his attraction to black music , his Army stint which blunted the momentum of his fame , and his peculiar pelvic and leg movements are given special attention . <p> And although it may be appalling that early Elvis never won a Grammy ( though it is understandable given that the gold standards for " artistic music excellence " at the time were the likes of Frank Sinatra ) the movie points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music from 1967 onwards . <p> Along the way , the docu 's flashback echoes the Luhrmann film 's depiction of Col.

At one point , Presley is even shown singing " Old McDonald Had a Farm , " which the docu views as shameful and demeaning . <p> We are thus made to believe that Presley 's TV special is a struggle not just to make a comeback , but also to break free , whenever possible , from Parker 's chains . For once , the King is seen not as a tragic figure or as a strange phenomenon , but as a " Rocky " figure seeking to reestablish a rightful claim to supremacy . <p> Considerable detail is devoted to the special , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the various songs he sang to the largely mature audiences ' joyous reactions to the rapturous eyewitness accounts of those who were there . The docu 's slant is that the special was basically a return to the young Elvis , the performer who captivated and scandalized audiences of the fifties . <p> Ultimately , this 2024 return to the King is also a plea to the oldies to forget about the Presley who sank into drugs and womanizing ( not tackled in this docu ) , and to the young ones to embrace the musical contributions of this man who made rock and roll and its spirit of rebellion socially acceptable . Every new generation whose musical tastes rival those of their parents ( and they always do ) can now say " Well , Elvis started it , and he was cool .

Plenty of money for rice importers and their friends in government . <p> It may be bad for the interest of rice importers , many of whom have protectors in high places , but what seems like the logical direction is for government to seriously support the development of alternatives to rice . Government must provide the funds , research , mechanism and organization on a sustained basis for such a program . <p> It will not only save the country millions in US dollars but it will also provide economic opportunities for farmers . <p> Rice , while loaded with other nutritional benefits , is basically a source for carbohydrates . Carbohydrates are our energy driver .

It has lower glycemic and insulin index values <p> Unfortunately , corn is perceived as the grain only the poor eat . Cooked corn grit is also harder than rice . <p> Adlai <p> Adlai is an ancient crop , also known as Job 's tears due to its teardrop shape . It has high protein , medium fat , and low sugar content . It has anti-tumor , anti-bacterial , anti-inflammatory , analgesic , blood sugar-lowering , and blood lipid-lowering effects . <p> It has been a minor grain crop grown in upland areas by the indigenous people of Mindanao . It is a hardy crop and tolerates dry periods . It is suited to mildly cool upland climate . <p> Cooked adlai grain has a subtle flavor and chewy texture that is similar to rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its medicinal properties and scarcity of supply , milled adlai costs P150 -- P200 per kg retail price . <p> Millet <p> Millet is one of the oldest cultivated grains in the world . While there are many varieties , " kabog " millet is the most grown and consumed in the country , especially in the Visayas region . <p> It is rich in niacin which is important for healthy skin and organ function . It also has beta-carotene that helps fight free radicals and supports the immune system . It has low-glycemic index ( GI ) that helps control blood sugar , soluble and non-soluble fiber and non-starchy polysaccharides <p> It is a good source of magnesium which may prevent heart failure , full of tannins , phytates , and phenols that help protect cells against damage and potential diseases like high blood pressure , diabetes , and high cholesterol . <p> There are other sources of carbohydrates like sweet potato , cassava , potatoes , even banana . We will discuss more in the next article . <p> Shifting Away from Rice <p> Rice is the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , lack of knowledge , lack of supply and even cultural bias ( corn and camote are eaten by poor people only ) prevent more Filipinos from shifting to healthier sources of carbohydrates . <p> Government should take serious and sustained action to educate Filipinos to widen their sources of carbohydrates , support and improve the cultivation of alternative grains , and research how to improve the taste and preparation as to make these more palatable to Filipinos . <p> It will not be an easy task . And rice importers and their cohorts in government will resist it . But the benefits of saving millions and to the health of the Filipinos should be incentives enough to do so . It will also open economic opportunities for the farmers . <p> ( MindaViews is the opinion section of MindaNews . Edmundo Y.

For context , always refer to the full article . <p> Alejandro Edoria <p> Left with arrogance without power , father and daughter begin to unravel <p> Made delusional by their phenomenal political successes -- they have never lost an election , for one thing -- the Dutertes must have been going through a shocking awakening : They are not untouchable , after all . <p> It was only 36 years ago when the first Duterte , Rodrigo , became mayor of their native Davao and began his family 's domination of that southern city . Rodrigo 's father , Vicente , had been elected governor of the province of Davao in 1959-1965 , before the province was split into north and south , and might have himself set the family on a political run , but he died early and it was not until 20 years later that Rodrigo decided to pick up where his father left off . <p> Twenty-eight years later he became the nation 's president , knowing no other way of running a political constituency than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that notorious experience . <p> By the time his presidency ended , in 2022 , a daughter had been elected vice-president , a son was in Congress , representing one of the three districts of their city , and another son was its mayor , a position the Dutertes always kept in the family . No wonder they had felt untouchable -- until they ran into the Marcoses . <p> The Marcoses may well be the ultimate in dynasties . Their patriarch , Ferdinand Marcos , ran the country as a plundering dictator for 14 years . A mere five years after he had been chased out into exile with his family , his heirs were back . In no time , they managed to establish themselves in high society and high-stakes politics , and within their generation they had their second president in the family . <p> Ferdinand II had Duterte 's daughter Sara for his vice-president , as such presumed to be the alliance 's next presidential candidate . But , in another validation of the truism , in politics particularly , that there are no permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alliance was short-lived . <p> The breakup appears to strike a popular chord , if not necessarily in favor of the Marcoses , against the Dutertes . If anything , that may have to do plainly with the way memory works : the more recent the occurrence , the easier to recall it . The two strongman regimes were separated by longer than a generation -- Ferdinand Marcos 's ( 1972-1986 ) and Rodrigo Duterte 's ( 2016-2022 ) . <p> In any case , their junking from the ruling coalition must have given the Dutertes the initial shock that jolted them out of their delusion -- they are supposed to be the rejector , not the rejected . The shock itself works like one continuous earthquake , and the epicenter is the Lower House of Congress , which is now administering the shock jolt-by-jolt at an inquiry whose primary " resource persons " -- as they are deferentially referred to -- are Rodrigo and Sara Duterte . <p> In Rodrigo 's case , the hearings center around his presidency 's war on drugs , which left tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given some of the most explosive testimonies , saying , for instance , that the war was a mere ruse , that it was actually a strategy by the Duterte family and its partners , chiefly Chinese , to eliminate rivals in the drug trade . <p> Sara Duterte , for her part , has attracted suspicions of anomalous payments from her confidential funds , whose very existence was outrageous enough , not to mention their size . For the two positions she concurrently held -- she has since been removed as education secretary -- these came to P612 million . No one before had been favored with such virtual blank-check entitlements , no vice-president , not remotely anyway , and definitely no education secretary . <p> But Sara Duterte felt not only entitled to them but entitled to do as she pleased with them .

Sara announces she has contracted someone to kill President Marcos and his wife and his cousin the Speaker , Martin Romualdez , the assassinations to be carried out upon her death , presuming it occurring at their hands . <p> Her father , on his part , calls out to the armed forces , urging them to mount a coup for what he calls " fractured governance . " Not to raise any fractured hopes myself , I must say I feel somewhat pleased that , for once where it truly counts , the Lower House is actually rising to the occasion -- while the Senate remains flaccid ; also , that the military leadership itself , taking no chances with the quality of Duterte 's bravado -- fractured or not -- sets him straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comes down from President Marcos as commander in chief . <p> The Dutertes try next to appropriate the memory of the million-strong street vigil that brought down the Marcos dictatorship , in 1986 ; they deploy a crowd at the EDSA Shrine , the monument to the revolt .

She heads the human rights organization Center for Civil Liberties , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 . She is recognized for her work documenting war crimes in Ukraine , embodying the courage to bear witness in times of crisis . <p> Here is the full text of her keynote speech : <p> I am a human rights lawyer , and for many years , I have been applying the law to protect people and human dignity . I have often heard that freedom and human rights are important , but economic benefits , geopolitical interests , and security concerns are even more significant . The fault of this approach is that freedom and peace are inextricably linked . States that grossly violate human rights pose a threat not only to their own citizens but to security and peace in general . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society step by step . But for a long time , the world turned a blind eye to this . Unpunished evil grows . Russian military committed terrible crimes in Chechnya , Moldova , Georgia , Syria , Mali , Libya . They have never been punished for it . Russia believes they can do whatever they want . And now as a human rights lawyer I am in a situation where the law does not work . <p> Russian troops are destroying residential buildings , churches , museums , schools , and hospitals . They are shooting at the evacuation corridors . They are torturing people in filtration camps . They are forcibly taking Ukrainian children to Russia . They ban the Ukrainian language and culture . They are abducting , robbing , raping and killing in the occupied territories . The entire UN system of peace and security can not stop it . <p> Let me share with you the story of 10-year-old boy Illya Matviyenko from Mariupol . Russian troops surrounded the city and did not allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother hid in the basement of their house from the Russian shelling . Like many people in the city , they melted snow to have water and made fires to cook at least some food . When the supplies ran out , they were forced to go out and consequently they became exposed to shelling . <p> His mother was wounded in her head , and the boy 's leg was torn . With the last of her strength , his mother dragged her son to a friend 's apartment . There was no medical assistance . Prior to this , the Russians destroyed the maternity hospital and the entire medical infrastructure in Mariupol . That is why in the apartment they lay down on the couch and just hugged each other . They were lying like that for several hours . This 10-year-old boy told to my colleague that his mother died and froze right in his arms . <p> I have one question . How we people , in the 21st century , will defend human beings , their lives , their freedom and their dignity ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal force matter ? <p> It is important to understand this not only for people in Ukraine , Syria , Iran , Nicaragua or Sudan . The answer to this question determines our common future . <p> 1 . There is no peace without justice . <p> War turns people into numbers . The scale of war crimes grows so fast that it becomes impossible to recognize all the stories . That why it is important to tell them . This is the story of 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov . He was killed by the Russian military near his own house . The tragedy received huge media coverage only because it was the first court trial since large-scale war . In the court , his wife Kateryna shared that her husband was an ordinary farmer , but he was her whole universe and now she 's losteverything . <p> People are not numbers . We must ensure justice for all , regardless of who the victims are , their social position , the type and level of cruelty they 've endured , and if the international organizations or media is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names . Because the life of each person matters . <p> 2 . Occupation is just another form of the war <p> I work with people who went through hell . Let me assure you that people in Ukraine dream about peace . But peace does not come when the country which was invaded stops fighting . That is not peace , that 's occupation . And occupation is the same war , but just in another form . <p> Occupation is not about changing one state flag to another . Occupation means enforced disappearances , torture , rapes , denial of your identity , forcible adoption of your own children , filtration camps , and mass graves . <p> This is a story of children writer Volodymyr Vakulenko . He wrote beautiful stories for children and entire generations grew up with his " Daddy 's book " . During the Russian occupation , Volodymyr disappeared . His family hoped to the last that he was alive and , like thousands of other Ukrainians , was in Russian captivity . But when Ukrainian army liberated his region we found mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number 319 we found the body of murdered children writer . II know his family . It is difficult for them to accept the results of the identification . <p> There is no legitimate reason for doing this . There is also no military necessity for it . Russians did these horrific things only because they could . <p> 3 . We need to reform the international system of peace and security <p> I do n't know how historians in the future will call this historical time . The world order , based on the UN Charter and international law , is collapsing before our eyes . The UN system , created after the Second World War established unjustified indulgences for individual countries . The work of Security Council is paralyzed . Now fires like wars will occur more and more frequently in different parts of the world because the international wiring is faulty and sparks are everywhere . <p> Russia started this war not in February 2022 , but in February 2014 . This was just after the Revolution of Dignity when millions of people in Ukraine had bravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the streets across the entire country . They peacefully demonstrated just for a chance to build a country where rights of each person are protected , government is accountable , judiciary is independent , and police do not beat students peacefully demonstrating . <p> When the authoritarian regime fell , Ukraine got its chance for democratic transformation . And to stop us on this way Russia invaded . Russia occupied Crimea and eastern regions in 2014 , and then in 2022 expanded this war into a full-scale invasion . Because Putin as every dictator is afraid of the idea of freedom . <p> That 's why it is not a war between two states . This is the war between two systems -- authoritarianism and democracy . Putin wants to convince the entire world that democracy , human rights and the rule of law are fake values . Because they do not protect anyone in the war . Putin wants to convince that a state with a powerful military potential and nuclear weapons can break the world order , dictate its rules to international community and even forcibly change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will encourage authoritarian leaders in various parts of the world to do the same . Governments will be forced to invest money not in education , health care , culture or business development , not in solving global problems such as climate change or social inequality , but in weapons . We will witness an increase in the number of nuclear states , using AI as a method of the war , the emergence of robotic armies and new weapons of mass destruction . If this scenario comes true , we will find ourselves in a world that will be dangerous for everyone without any exception . <p> 4 . We are losing freedom in the world <p> Half of the population in the world this year goes to elections . But do n't be in the illusion . More than 80% of people around the world live in not-free or partially free societies . This means that people who have the right to vote for whom they want , to say what they think , to love whomever their hearts tell them to love , and to choose freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority . <p> The problem is not only that the space of freedom in authoritarian countries has narrowed to the size of a prison cell . The problem is that even in democracies , people starting to call into question the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . <p> There are reasons for this . The coming generations inherited democracy from their parents . They began to take human rights for granted . They have become consumers of democracy . They understand freedom as possibility to choose between different cheeses in the supermarket . <p> Yet , the truth is that freedom is very fragile . Human rights are not attained once and forever . We make our choice every day . <p> 5 . People can change the history <p> I have been working with the law for many years , and I know for sure that if you can not rely on legal mechanisms , you can always rely on people . We are used to thinking in categories of states and interstate organizations . But ordinary people have much more impact than they can even imagine . Ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish anyone to go through war experience . Nevertheless , these dramatic times provide us an opportunity to reveal the best in us -- to be courageous , to fight for freedom , to take the burden of responsibility , to make difficult but right choices , to help each other . Only when we are helping each other , we are acutely aware what does it mean to be a human . <p> And I am here to say that despite everything , the story of Ukraine is life-affirming story , because these are dramatic times that raise hope . When freedom is denied , it starts to powerfully break out through the concrete individuals . <p> I am here to say that in different countries worldwide in this concrete moment many people also fight for freedom and human dignity . Sometimes this fight may seem to be senseless because they face with enormous opposing power . However , the total history of humankind convincingly proves that we should not give up . Even , when we have no tools , our own words and our own position always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And let me finish with the words of Desmond Tutu : " If you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor " . <p> We are fighting for freedom that has no limitation in national borders . As well as human solidarity . Our future is unclear but not prewritten . Nevertheless , we still have a chance to fight for the peaceful democratic future we wish for ourselves and our children . -- Rappler.com

This scenario embodies the informal economy , where self-employed workers operate independently outside formal labor regulations . Often devoid of social protection , this sector 's vulnerability is measured by the proportion of own-account and contributing family workers . The Philippines ' Labor Force Survey reveals that 38.3 percent of employed individuals fall into this category , underscoring the precariousness of their work arrangements and heightened susceptibility to crises or shocks . <p> THE lack of a comprehensive strategy that allows the Philippines to address global headwinds and exploit opportunities at the same time will make it difficult for the administration to reach its growth goals , economists said Tuesday . <p> In the years following 2020 , the height of the Covid-19 pandemic , the Philippine economy enjoyed robust growth , even exceeding its historical GDP average of 6 percent in 2022 when the economy grew 7.6 percent . <p> However , this growth was fueled mainly by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unsustainable strategies that caused the country to keep trailing its neighbors . <p> " These trends are related in such a way that a comprehensive strategy can be designed to effectively address all challenges and exploit opportunities at the same time , " Lanzona told BusinessMirror . <p> " Unfortunately , we have not seen such a comprehensive strategy from the government . Instead , all we see are infrastructure and the continuous flow of social protection that are not sustainable , " he added . <p> Lanzona , however , called this a feeble attempt from the administration to cover up the <p> reality that " Covid-19 changed everything , including the global economy .

This could slow down the country 's exports growth . <p> He added that as geopolitical risks persist , the income and remittances from Filipinos overseas could suffer . <p> Nonetheless , Asuncion said the new goal is a good one but it comes with a challenge . In the absence of new taxes , the government must focus on better collection should be prioritized , he added . <p> Lanzona , however , thinks it may be impossible to meet this goal without new taxes as the Create More lowered corporate taxes .
