@@105204237 <h> Viewpoint : More than plugs -- unpacking the future of green mobility infra in Indonesia <p> The author Kenneth Darmansjah is the co-founder and CEO of Soul Parking , an Indonesian startup backed by AC Ventures specialising in efficient motorcycle parking solutions and electric vehicle charging points . <p> Indonesia 's ambitious energy transition goals are set to transform the country , as stakeholders from the public and private sectors recognise the environmental challenges the nation faces . <p> Currently , the transport sector is responsible for 15% of the country 's greenhouse gas emissions where about half are caused by road passenger transport -- cars and motorcycles . There are currently more than 120 million motorcycles on the streets today in the country . This is largely due to rapid urbanisation rates across Indonesia which will only increase as the nation continues to prosper . <p> With this in mind , the decarbonisation of this industry is a crucial factor in driving Indonesia toward its 2060 net-zero goal . A strong foundation to foster a transition to electric vehicles ( EVs ) is already underway , where the government has established incentives for both consumers and businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push things forward . <p> For instance , the Indonesian government plans to allocate 7 trillion rupiah ( $459 million ) to support the sales of 800,000 new electric motorcycles and the conversion of 200,000 combustion engine motorcycles by 2024 ( granted there is still much work to be done on the conversion front ) . On the business side , Indonesia extended the deadline for automakers to qualify for EV incentives by another two years -- this relaxed investment rule requires automakers to produce at least 40% of EV components in the country to enjoy a plate of tax incentives . <p> However , electrification of fleets and EV manufacturing for consumers represent only parts of the green mobility value chain . The other equally important part is the infrastructure built to sustain the use of EVs on the road . The increased availability of a robust charging infrastructure network plays a critical role here . <p> For now , there are 439 general charging stations and 961 battery swap stations available for EVs in Indonesia but these figures are expected to increase as the EV changeover continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's sole electricity provider , has already set a target to establish 6,316 general charging stations and 14,000 battery swap stations by 2025 . <h> Charging ahead of the EV curve <p> These targets set by government entities like PLN illustrate that the country is more than determined to forge ahead in accelerating EV adoption and growth . <p> At Soul Parking , we are focused on bringing innovation to the urban mobility sector . As we transition into a green mobility era , it 's only right that we play a role in accelerating the sector 's growth . <p> Last year , the Ministry of Mineral Resources ambitiously said that it aims to convert 150,000 fuel-run motorcycles into electric ones in 2024 . By the end of the decade , Indonesia looks to have 13 million electric two-wheelers on the roads . <p> We see this as an opportunity for us to double down on our mission of alleviating street-side congestion but with an EV twist . A few months ago , we started incorporating EV charging stations and storage facilities for both electric two- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger vehicle market will continue to increase as Indonesia 's megacities like Jakarta keep growing , so the challenge of finding space for parking and charging infrastructure remains -- it 's a natural play for us to turn to supplying charging stations at our parking facilities . <p> We also decided to go one step further by implementing fully automated solar-powered ticketing machines at parking lots . This is because we understand the importance and relevance of tapping into other forms of renewable energy . As we work with landowners , government bodies , and property developers , we are confident that these things can help create a ripple effect that will help alleviate not just traffic woes but also carbon emissions across the nation . <h> Driving into an electrified future <p> While EVs for vehicle owners are a big part of Indonesia 's green mobility push , it 's not the end all be all . Optimising public transportation is also something the Indonesian government is working on to ease traffic congestion and carbon emissions . <p> To this end , Jakarta 's JakLingko , the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daily public transport commuters from 350,000 to 1 million . The initiative provides mobility-as-a-service by integrating various public transportation services from the first to the last mile and several payment methods into a unified platform . Commuters can plan , pay for , and book transportation for their entire journey via JakLingko . <p> Additionally , PT MRT Jakarta ( Perseroda ) , the company that runs Jakarta 's metro system , saw a lot more people using their trains in 2023 . About 33.5 million people rode the MRT that year , which is 14 million more than in 2022 when around 19.7 million people used it . <p> To get more people to use the MRT , the company is working with different groups , especially those in tourism like food businesses , event organizers , malls , and health and education players , and they 're offering special ticket deals at tourist spots . They 're also teaming up with other local transport services to make it easier for people to get to the MRT stations . A big help has been the Dukuh Atas Jakarta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy to switch between different types of transport . This hub , along with its parking managed by Soul Parking , makes it simpler for people to use car-sharing services . These extra transport options have not only increased the number of MRT riders by about 22% but also encouraged more people to share rides instead of using their cars . <p> As a result , this helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26% and at the same time reduced commuters ' monthly spending on public transport from 30% to 8% , said the city 's governor , adding the next step is to procure only electric buses for the city . <p> The success of JakLingko also highlights that there need to be parallel initiatives -- in this case , the development of a unified transportation payment management platform and the electrification of buses -- to further drive home the message that green mobility is the future and that commuters have nothing to lose while the country undergoes a major energy transition . <p> According to a recent ADB report , low-carbon mobility and clean power bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue across Southeast Asia by 2030 . Indonesia as the largest country in the region would naturally benefit , especially when the country 's current 0.2% EV penetration rate is similar to China 's ten years ago , pointing to massive growth potential as we drive ahead with our clean energy transition . <p> The urgency and potential of a successful energy transition in Indonesia is evident . Startups that can innovate within the clean energy sectors could make a lasting impact on Indonesia 's energy transition journey . <p> However , Indonesia can not do this alone and startups are only part of the equation . Capital financing from institutional investors is an essential component of the country 's journey to net zero . <p> In 2022 's G20 Summit , the government reinforced its commitment to its net-zero ambition , highlighting that a transition to zero-emission vehicles is one of its main agenda points . But beyond EV manufacturing , many adjacent verticals such as battery swapping , battery recycling , and EV aftermarket servicing require significant investment and partnerships from investors to spur growth . This could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain a deep understanding of the nuances and challenges of the industry . <p> It will be a long road for Indonesia to achieve such an energy paradigm shift but the participation of institutional investors will certainly accelerate its progress .

According to people Eco-Business spoke to at the market , killing dogs out of sight introduces new dangers for the people who eat it , as many dogs are poisoned using potassium , which contaminates the meat . <p> Minahasa people are believed to have eaten dog meat since the 1930s , when dogs that were previously used for hunting found themselves on the meal table during a period of war and famine . Like eating chicken and pork in the Christian-majority region , dog meat is not taboo and is typically eaten at funerals and other special occasions and is considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general treatment of dogs in Tomahon and elsewhere in North Sulawesi is not considered poor . Some locals who eat dog also keep dogs as pets . One man who works at the market selling dog meat has a pet dog , and told Eco-Business he would never consider eating his pet . <p> Eco-Business visited a local hot spring believed to have physical and spiritual healing properties , where a man was bathing his dog with shampoo . Lasut rescued her dog from a rubbish bin when he was a puppy . The mongrel , which is healthy and well fed , follows her wherever she goes , even when she is doing laps at the local military swimming pool . <h> Pandemic and rabies risks <p> Dogs are no longer slaughtered at bushmeat markets , but dog meat continues to be sold . Image : Robin Hicks / Eco-Business <p> The dog meat trade is a potential reservoir of rabies , a zoonotic disease that causes unimaginable suffering in people and animals before they inevitably die . Through the transportation of dogs of unknown disease and vaccination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catchers and butchers are rarely vaccinated . <p> Cases of human rabies have doubled in Indonesia since the pandemic , and cases in North Sulawesi have been among the highest in Indonesia . According to a study of 11 dog heads retrieved from the market by AFMI in 2016 , three tested positive for rabies . Some animal welfare activists believe that the dog meat trade reduces rabies risk by reducing the free-roaming dog population , which is responsible for 99 per cent of human rabies cases . <p> Minahasa people also eat cats , another rabies carrier , although none are for sale at Pasar Ekstrim . Cat meat is " heaty " , it makes the body warmer -- like eating Durian , says Lasut . <p> More worrying , perhaps , is the potential of Pasar Ekstrim , and other markets like it , becoming ground-zero for the next pandemic . Hygiene standards at the market are far from meticulous and various species of butchered animal lie side by side , exposed to the elements . <p> One theory for the cause of Covid-19 is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market in Wuhan , China . Bats , hundreds of which are sold at Pasar Ekstrim every weekend , are notorious disease transmitters because of their powerful immune systems . The SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) virus , which killed 800 people in 2002 , is believed to have originated in bats before spreading to civets in a wildlife market in China . <p> In 2021 , Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) and other conservation non-profits called on wildlife markets to be shut down , because of the pandemic risk they pose , particularly markets like Tomohon , which are located in urban areas where there are high concentrations of animals and people . <p> " The crowding together in urban markets of live wildlife and fresh meat from different species , close to people and other animals , provides the perfect conditions for recombination , sharing , and shedding of viruses and other pathogens and their transmission to humans , " WCS said in the paper , which was published at the height of the pandemic . <p> A 2016 study of six bats retrieved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive for a strain of coronavirus . AFMI tried to use the test results to persuade the authorities to shut the market down in 2020 , at the height of the pandemic , but AFMI executive Frank Delano Manus says his requests were ignored and the connection between bats and zoonotics diseases dismissed as a rumour . During the pandemic period , the market was shut down for just four days . <p> Manus says that one lever that can be used to close the bushmeat market down is tourism . A poll of foreign visitors to the market by AFMI in 2016 found that 80 per cent disapproved of wildlife and domestic animals being sold at the market . <p> Another lever is public safety . According to an investigation of the wildlife market supply chain by AFMI , most animals for sale at the bushmeat market are captured and killed in other parts of Sulawesi , transported and stored in iced boxes , and are not sold for up to two weeks after slaughter . <h> An alternative to Indonesia 's bush meat trade <p> A little over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildlife market is a nature reserve packed with a bewildering diversity of animal species that can only be found in North Sulawesi .

Guides shine flash lights into the sensitive eyes of noctural tarsiers so that visitors can take clearer photos of the animals at dusk , and one guide said that a Chinese tourist had paid IDR50,000 ( US$3.20 ) for a python to be removed from a tree for a photo opportunity . <p> Sulawesi Crested black macaques .

Local villagers have been taught to identify wildlife species by guides , so that they can help to monitor populations and are more invested in their protection and could themselves work as guides . Various media companies , including most recently the BBC , have visited the area to document the wildlife , and locals can earn up to IDR350,000 ( US$22.50 ) a day just from carrying camera equipment . <p> The push for stronger legal sanctions against wildlife trafficking is also largely due to the growing online trade of protected species . <p> " We have a lot of regulations , but none are properly enforced , " says Manus . " Money can buy everything here . "

Children look on from the bridge above . Image : Samantha Ho / Eco-Business <h> Can Jambi 's farmers offer the world a model of sustainable agriculture and reforestation ? <h> While it might be a temporary solution , the use of palm oil credits , facilitated by leading certifier RSPO , has been crucial in funding sustainable production and regenerative agricultural efforts , say smallholders and industry observers . <p> It is afternoon on a small , remoteoil palm plantation in Jambi , Indonesia . Together with visitors from other various international organisations , I am taking shelter from the sun , standing under some towering palm trees and wearing a hard hat . Our shoes let out soft squelches as they shift on a carpet of damp husk-like residue , that is the remnants of palm fruits already harvested for their main use -- their edible oil . <p> We are on a trip facilitated by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsibly and sustainably sourced , and the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil Farmers ' Forum ( Fortasbi ) . They have arranged for us tospeak with Jambi 's smallholder farmers and take a closer look at how the province 's growers have managed to adopt whatboth organisations say are more innovative and regenerative practices , partly with the support of additional income from RSPO 's smallholder credit mechanism . <p> Imron Rosjidi , one of Jambi 's many palm oil smallholders who benefits in part from the credit system , is showing us around the two-hectare plantation which he owns and manages . What we are stepping on , known as empty fruit bunches ( EFBs ) , are often treated by local smallholders as waste . But Rosjidi has chosen to apply the material as fertiliser , which he gets for free from nearby mills since it is discarded after oil palm is processed . <p> Rosjidi 's distribution of the mulch around the bases of the palm trees is a method that draws from how larger plantations use EFBs as organic fertiliser . Unlike those sites , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the base of the trees instead of being apart between each tree . <p> This method nourishes the roots of the trees which have been damaged due to extensive use of chemical fertilisers and a long drought that had begun in June this year , exacerbated by El Ni ? o weather conditions , said Rosjidi . Furthermore , although it is not visible at the time of our visit , Rosjidi explained that edible mushrooms will soon sprout across the EFB layer , given that the plantation had just seen a drizzle early in the morning . During peak rainy season , which is approaching , the mushrooms are harvested as often as twice a day , he shared . <p> Rosjidi is one of 349 members of Asosiasi Petani Berkah Mandah Lestari ( APBML ) , a Jambi-based smallholders association whose members collectively received RSPO certification for producing sustainable palm oil in 2019 , and which also raises additional revenue via the sales of RSPO credits . Small-scale land ownership gives him more flexibility to innovate , and according to Rosjidi , his non-conventional methods supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative agricultural practices in 2019 , the yield on his plantation has nearly doubled from about 17 tonnes of palm oil per month to as much as 30 tonnes . <p> " In the beginning , our palm fruits were dry and not worth much . After using organic fertiliser , we saw big changes in the quality of our palm fruits , " he said , while speaking to the visiting group , which also included global representatives from RSPO , as well as procurement and sustainability executives from palm oil-buying consumer goods companies in Europe and Japan . <p> Imron Rosjidi , a palm oil smallholder , stands on the empty fruit bunches used as organic fertiliser on his oil palm plantation in Jambi . During the rainy season , mushrooms grow and are harvested twice a day on the fertiliser , which are cooked and sold .

Bella Sosa , a visitor who hails from Honduras and is the Latin America smallholder manager for RSPO said : " I 've never seen this being done before . " <p> On a wider scale , the revenue APBML has raised via the sales of RSPO credits since its certification -- about 1.6 billion rupiah ( US$103,967 ) -- has gone towards supporting local environmental and social causes such as the establishment of a conservation area surrounding Sungai Asam , a river located in the northern part of Jambi . <p> The one-kilometre site has been under protected status since 2021 . Fishing and garbage dumping are banned , and APBML is also replanting native fruit trees along the river banks , which had previously been cleared for palm oil cultivation . The initiatives are rooted in a practice known as lubuk larangan , which translates to " forbidden pit " but refers to demarcating part of a local river based on community agreement not to disturb the river ecosystem , such as fishing in the zone for a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been recently revived and according to academics , stem from a cultural appreciation for community and local knowledge . <p> " We plant fruit trees instead of hardwood trees because we want to rehabilitate the area for animals such as monkeys , " said APBML group manager Ardiansyah . " We have destroyed the natural habitats by planting oil palm trees , so now we need to feed the animals . " <p> Mushrooms , grown on empty fruit bunches on Imron Rosjidi 's small plantation in Jambi , Indonesia , were fried as a crispy snack . Image : RSPO <p> Saplings planted on the site , which range from coffee and candlenut to guava and petai ( bitter bean ) , are grown by a local group of women nursery managers . They have sold more than 4,500 trees to smallholder associations like APBML and social forestry farmers , raising over US$920 over the past few years . APBML also supports the women-led eco-printing business , in which locally sourced leaves and natural dyes are used to create patterned fabrics . <p> Another RSPO-certified smallholder group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recently celebrated the reopening of their own lubuk larangan in western Jambi after a five-year ban on fishing and pollution , but there are now concerns of disruption if demand for sustainable palm oil credits fall and in turn impact on financial support that is vital to sustaining these conservation efforts . <p> Guntur Cahyo Prabowo , head of smallholders for RSPO , in an opinion piece recently penned , writes that there is the risk of diminishing incentives for buyers to purchase Independent Smallholder ( ISH ) credits with the impending enforcement of the European Union Deforestation Regulation ( EUDR ) , since the physical suppply of palm oil can now be proven to be compliant with the new anti-deforestation rules . <p> This means that buyers could exclude smallholders with no access to certified mills or other means to prove compliance , argued Prabowo . " While there other ways to support smallholders , ISH credits are a proven , practical and well-targeted method of providing economic relief and inclusion in the sustainable production model , " he said , stating that if companies decide that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer . <p> In Jambi alone , of the 1.15 million hectares of oil palm plantations in Jambi , more than 600,000 hectares are owned and managed by smallholders . <p> Ardiansyah also worries that strict requirements for sourcing palm oil under the EUDR would affect conservation efforts and the earnings of smallholders across the country . <p> " We are afraid that with the onset of EUDR , Indonesian oil palm farmers will fall below the poverty line , " said Ardiansyah , who adds that the lives of Jambi 's families have significantly improved today with the proceeds from selling sustainable palm oil credits , with some being able to afford to send their children to study in the capital city of Jakarta , which is regarded as a mark of progress . This should not be reversed , he said . <h> Credits : a temporary solution <p> Under the EUDR , all buyers of agricultural goods imported into Europe must prove that the imports do not originate from recently deforested land . This involves ensuring that palm oil is traceable along the supply chain , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to showing proof of legal land use and ensuring that the palm oil processing mills only process deforestation-free fresh fruit bunches ( FFBs ) . <p> RSPO already requires geolocation data from its certified smallholders to prove that their products are deforestation-free . However , smallholders are not always able to sell their harvested FFBs to certified mills , either due to these mills being too far from their farms or because at times , the daily price offered by uncertified mills is higher . Smallholders across Indonesia face this price mismatch , I learnt at a smallholder event in Jakarta held on the sidelines of RSPO 's annual conference in November . <p> Rukaiyah Rafik , head of secretariat for Fortasbi , said that while the credit mechanism is not ideal -- buyers would ideally buy sustainably grown palm oil directly -- RSPO credits have been crucial in supporting sustainable production efforts by smallholders . <p> " Credits are a temporary solution , " Rafik told me . She described it as a mode of transaction for sustainable palm oil by proxy , before infrastructure and systems can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fortasbi is collaborating with American food manufacturer Cargill to facilitate the purchase of FFBs directly from smallholders , using RSPO 's preserved and segregated palm oil scheme .

She is accompanied by Rukaiyah Rafik , head of the sectretariat at sustainable palm oil non-profit Yayasan Fortasbi Indonesia ( right ) . Image : Samantha Ho / Eco-Business <h> Local government support <p> Jambi 's local government acknowledged that it also has much to do to improve infrastructure and connectivity to grow sustainable palm oil production , even as it strives to reshape Jambi 's image as a hotspot for forest and peatland fires into one that pioneers and leads on sustainable agriculture efforts . <p> Forest fires in Jambi have led to transboundary haze pollution , affecting air quality in Singapore and Malaysia . During previous El Ni ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and was last at its worst in 2015 and 2019 , Jambi was among the regions with the most hotspots and unhealthiest air quality detected . The origins and management of transboundary haze has been a source of disagreement between Southeast Asian countries . <p> Traditional slash-and-burn techniques used by smallholders to clear their land have been villainised in the media , but Indonesian sustainability advocate Aida Greenbury argues that this blame has been misplaced . She said that large companies have encouraged this narrative to deflect criticism for their draining of peatlands for palm oil plantations . <p> In Jambi , smallholders under APBML currently do not deforest or clear their land using burning techniques , and none have experienced haze over the past year , Ardiansyah told me . <p> In fact , the practice of slash and burn has been banned as a form of land clearing in the province . On the trip to Jambi , I spotted large billboards erected along main roads that warn against using this technique We were also informed that the local government has offered to subsidise the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This year , we have assisted smallholders who want to clear land using heavy machinery instead of burning , " said Agus Rizal , head of Jambi 's plantation agency . The local government also encourages the farming of different crops instead of palm oil monoculture , by handing out seedlings for crops such as coffee and cinnamon , he said . <p> However , errant companies in Jambi have paid locals to covertly start fires for land clearing even though any form of open burning is illegal , locals told me . Arrests have been made in recent months in relation to suspected involvement in forest fires . <p> A map shows the different social forestry and sustainable palm oil smallholder groups that are working together on the edge of the Bukit 30 National Park in Jambi to restore riparian and riverine habitats .

" We have identified four districts that are at the highest risk of forest and land fires , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of satellite technology to detect hotspots early , increasing the number of patrols and rotating watchguards between different locations on a monthly basis , he added . <p> " There is no technology that can stop the fires once they have started and at those times , we can only pray for rain , but we are actively taking precautionary measures to prevent fires in the first place , " Sudirman said . <p> Rizal added that the local government is focused on convincing the global market that Jambi is " fully committed to implementing sustainable plantation practices " , including the protection of forested lands . According to Rizal , Jambi is home to 2.1 million hectares of natural forests , much of which is protected as part of national parks . Much of these parks extend into neighbouring provinces and at least one of the protected forests is home to the Indigenous Suku Anak Dalam tribe . <p> " To grow the palm oil industry , we are helping communities develop palm oil plantations outside forested areas , by providing sponsorships and assistance for fertilisers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> The government is also working on building an inventory of smallholders in Jambi , which will include geolocation and legality data as required by international regulations such as the EUDR . <p> At the national level , the Indonesian government has mandated that all palm oil growers apply for certification under the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil ( ISPO ) sustainability certification scheme . Compared to the RSPO scheme , ISPO has stricter rules requiring producers to prove legal land ownership . <p> Smallholders have a deadline of 2025 to secure ISPO certification , although many argue that they need more financial and administrative support to meet the requirements , including help with the preparation of legal documents . <p> To help these smallholders , Rizal said that the Jambi government has leveraged the BioCarbon Fund , backed by the World Bank and distributed under the Jambi Sustainable Landscape Management Project . Via the fund , the administration has helped secure registration letters for all plantation and cultivation businesses this year , he said . <p> " These are our initiatives to ensure that Jambi-produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EUDR , " said Rizal . <p> Jambi smallholders , too , are eager to demonstrate that palm oil sourced from their plantations are deforestation-free and meet global sustainability standards . <p> " We hope that the international community can help us convince the global market that we are ready to meet ( their demands for ) sustainable palm oil , " said Ardiansyah . <p> Eco-Business ' access to smallholders and local government officials in Jambi , as well as the sponsored trip to Jakarta and the plantation site , was facilitated by RSPO and Fortasbi . <p> Correction note ( 4 Jan 2024 ) : An earlier version of the article stated that the women nursey managers had raised US$260 million over the past few years in sales and that the revenue is used as start-up capital for other businesses . The actual figure should be US$920 and proceeds from the seedling sales do not directly support its eco-printing business . It also misstated the total tree cover in Jambi . These have been corrected . We apologise for the errors .

@@105455239 <h> ' Sustainability must be accessible ' : Arthaland 's CSO on making sustainable real estate in the Philippines a norm <h> If a real estate development can reduce energy and water consumption -- and emit fewer carbon emissions -- it is built to last , Oliver Chan tells the Eco-Business podcast . The key , however , is to first educate future homeowners and businesses that going green does not mean breaking the bank . <p> When people think about climate change , most are quick to blame the burning of fossil fuels , vehicle emissions , and deforestation . <p> However , what many may not realise is that the buildings in which we live and work are also responsible for climate change ; almost 40 per cent of global carbon emissions stem from the round-the-clock cooling , heating , lighting and powering of appliances in buildings , with the remaining 11 per cent from materials and construction . The issue is compounded in cities , which consume almost 80 per cent of the world 's energy . <p> One city that is adversely affected by high levels of energy consumption is the Philippine capital of Manila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of over 14 million people and a population density of over 42,000 people per square kilometre , it is the most densely populated city in the world . There is a correlation between the high population density and increasing levels of heat stress in the city , which is when people are unable to cool themselves enough to maintain a healthy temperature and typically caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures and humidity , and physical exertion . <p> Manila 's year-round tropical climate adds to the heat stress and sees the city struggling to meet the power supply . City-wide blackouts are mainly attributed to the high demand for indoor cooling and air conditioning during the warmer months of the city 's dry season . Key infrastructure , such as the city 's airport which saw two blackouts in 2023 alone , are not spared either . <p> The issue of water shortage has also plagued Manila in recent years , with the issue exacerbated by its rapid population growth , inadequate water supply infrastructure , and delays in new water source projects , and -- not least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 per cent less rainfall in the first six months of 2023 compared to the nation 's long-term average , with the decrease in precipitation attributed to the El Ni ? o weather phenomenon . Since July 2023 , more than half a million households have had to endure up to 11 hours of water supply interruptions as water levels of the Angat Dam -- which currently supplies 98 per cent of potable water in Metro Manila -- dipped below minimum operating levels . <p> These are some reasons why better solutions are needed to improve the city 's air quality , reduce emissions , and wean the city 's reliance on finite sources , emphasises Oliver Chan , chief sustainability officer of Philippine real estate developer Arthaland , who speaks to Eco-Business about the growing sustainable real estate market in the Philippines . <p> Tune in as we discuss : <p> How sustainable buildings can reduce energy consumption and help Philippine households cope with periodic water shortages ; <p> Reasons why more businesses and customers are opting for sustainable real estate ; <p> The example the company strives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces its fair share of climate threats , from multiple typhoons each year , flooding , heatwaves , and extreme temperatures this year in particular . At the same time , the price of electricity in the Philippines -- among the highest in Asia -- may rise along with increasing energy consumption and contribute to carbon emissions over the next few decades . How does sustainable real estate play a part in reducing carbon emissions ? <p> Sustainable real estate plays a huge role in reducing carbon emissions . First of all , the specifications of these buildings alone can reduce energy usage by about 20 per cent -- at the minimum and when tenants consume less energy , they produce fewer carbon emissions -- but what are these specifications you look for in a real estate development ? <p> Firstly , in terms of water consumption , rainwater recycling is crucial . This system collects and recycles rainwater , which is then used for flushing toilets and irrigating plants . Implementing rainwater recycling alone can save about 20 to 30 per cent of water consumption . <p> Next is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even triple-glazed glass helps to minimise how much heat enters a building . Additionally , proper ventilation , including mechanical air intake and exhaust systems , is essential . The choice of mechanical equipment , such as energy-efficient air conditioning units , also contributes to energy savings . All of these measures combined result in reduced carbon emissions . <h> Arthaland Century Pacific Tower is the world 's first Edge Zero Carbon-certified building . Can you speak on the significance of this achievement and the lengths the company had to go to accomplish this ? <p> What 's significant is that we are a relatively small and young real estate company ; we have only been about for around 15 years . In the Philippines , we do n't even rank among the top five or 10 largest companies in the industry . However , by demonstrating that a smaller real estate company can successfully adopt sustainability initiatives , we hope to inspire others to realise that it is possible . We achieved this by putting our minds to it and focusing on what needed to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs that are associated with sustainability . But once you understand sustainability , you realise that cost does n't have to be an issue . <p> We were the first Edge Zero Carbon building to be recognised by the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) in the Philippines in 2019 . Since then , the number of Edge Zero-certified buildings in the country has grown to nearly 100 by 2023 . This progress signifies that when people witness successful examples , they are inspired to follow suit . <h> Would you say sustainable real estate has increased in popularity in the Philippines over the last decade ? <p> Yes , significantly . One factor is the influx of multinational companies entering the Philippines , such as Microsoft and Google . These companies are attracted to the country due to lower operational expenses , lower rent , and a relatively lower cost of living . <p> Sustainable building design , which can lead to lower energy consumption and cost savings for these companies , is also leading to increased demand from multinational companies and motivating developers to prioritise sustainable building practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about making real estate sustainable in the Philippines ? <p> For me , it 's acceptance . You need a lot of buy-in -- not only from within your company -- but also from external forces . One example is suppliers , as not all of them are observing sustainable practices as of today , and not all of them have sustainable products . <p> That is the most challenging aspect of sustainable building projects -- getting others to accept that sustainability will benefit them in the long run . When people start thinking about how sustainability can provide long-term financial gains , only then can they realise that it is the best investment they can make today . <h> Are more buyers or tenants seeking to live or invest in sustainable property ? <p> Yes , we are seeing more . The majority , composed of the younger generation , first-time homebuyers , and families just starting out , are seeking sustainable real estate . In the Philippines , more individuals aim to buy their first home and intend for the home to be their last ; they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I view this the same way as well . I have kids aged six , four , and four months old -- and I want to give them a real estate investment that would last upwards of 30 or 40 years , or their lifetime , without them seeing the value decrease . I believe you can only do this with sustainable development . <p> Health considerations also play a significant role . In my case , my six-year-old has asthma . Every week , I take him out on a trip two-and-a-half hours away up north just to get some fresh air . <p> Sustainable developments , which can help to ensure good air quality , create an ideal place for families to live and raise their children . These factors are important in convincing the market that projects with sustainable features are the way to go . <h> How do you communicate the value of sustainability to potential buyers or tenants ? <p> For us , it 's about finding ways to make our message relatable to our audience . <p> Take electricity , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippines has faced ongoing issues with blackouts and high electricity rates due to a lack of supply . By showing them how sustainable buildings can address these problems , people begin to realise how important this is . <p> Water shortage is another prevalent issue in the country -- often making headlines . By highlighting how our building features can help address this concern , people see the value in sustainability . <h> " <p> Our actions today have a lasting impact on future generations -- we may not feel the effects immediately , but future generations , especially the younger kids , will experience the consequences . <p> Oliver Chan , chief sustainability officer , Arthaland <h> On that note , there is a need to balance sustainability with affordability , as sustainable features may increase the cost of a property .

" <p> For instance , we recently launched a mid-scale development featuring 28-square-metre studio units complete with sustainable features . <p> In addition , we have partnered with the national government to create a financing programme specifically for buyers of these affordable units . <p> In the Philippines , traditional bank mortgages typically come with annual interest rates of around 6.5 per cent to 8 per cent , which are only fixed for the first three years . <p> To partner with banks , projects must be certified sustainable by recognised bodies . This ensures buyers can secure a 15 to 30-year loan with a maximum interest rate of 4.5 per cent , which is 40 per cent lower than what banks offer , making sustainable developments more affordable . <p> We believe that understanding and education are key to advancing sustainability .

What must sustainable real estate developers focus on in the decades ahead and what sort of legacy in sustainability real estate does Arthaland hope to leave behind ? <p> Well , in the aftermath of the pandemic , it seemed that everyone was jumping on the sustainability bandwagon , seeing it as a mere trend . <p> However , sustainability is not just a passing fad . It is a belief system that should be practised not only at work but also at home . If we view it as a trend , it becomes nothing more than a marketing ploy . <p> For us , it is important to do what 's best for our buyers and investors . When we sell properties , we often emphasise capital appreciation and provide the best deal . <p> But how can we deliver on these promises if we are n't sustainable ?

It is a daunting task . Therefore , in my opinion , belief and focus on sustainability are the key and only way forward . <p> For us , it 's about leaving a legacy for future generations . We want to make sure that the projects we leave behind will be there for future generations to use . That 's our first priority . <p> Additionally , we want to ensure sustainability is implemented across all market segments . Whether it 's for the rich , the middle market , or even for those less fortunate , sustainability must be accessible and beneficial for everyone . <h> As a Chief Sustainability Officer of a real estate company , what about sustainability or sustainable real estate do you feel most strongly or passionate about , and why ? <p> For me , it 's all about leaving a better world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world with clean and fresh air , where they can move freely and enjoy a long and healthy life . That 's the ultimate goal for me . <p> That 's why I am so passionate about pushing for sustainability .

It feels as though people are unintentionally poisoning children from today without even realising it . We wo n't be here in a few decades , but our children will . So why make it difficult for them -- especially if we can make positive changes today ? <h> Is there anything you 'd like to add ? <p> For me , sustainability is about education , understanding and believing in what you think is possible .

It emphasizes the concerning increase of bribery under the Kim Jong-un regime . <p> Furthermore , the report underscores the growing discontent among North Koreans regarding the hereditary succession of the country 's leadership and the widespread negative public assessment of the performance of Kim Jong-un as a political leader . <p> " When viewed as a whole , it seems that North Korea is experiencing changes from the grassroots level , as we hope , " the minister said . <p> The minister also reiterated that " From a universal perspective , if marketization occurs , it seems inevitable that conflicts will eventually arise between the power of the market and the power of authority in North Korea . " <p> Dilemma of hereditary dictatorship <p> Though North Korea is transitioning to a fourth-generation leadership , the Kim regime will continue to grapple with instability , as it faces " the dilemma of hereditary dictatorship " which is incapable of reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Kim Jong-un can not criticize the policies of his grandfather and founder of North Korea , Kim Il-sung , or his father , Kim Jong-il , as he inherited power from them , drawing a stark contrast from the Chinese transition of power . <p> " Therefore , if trapped in this dilemma , the economy will inevitably stagnate . Generally speaking , if a country seeks to enhance and sustain military power , it should be supported by economic strength , " he said , questioning the sustainability of its leadership . <p> North Korea directs a substantial portion of its resources , potentially surpassing 50 percent of its gross domestic product , towards nuclear and missile buildup . <p> The Kim dynasty has embraced another inherent instability . <p> " The crux of maintaining a political system lies in democratically and stably institutionalizing the succession of supreme power . Hence , when viewed through this lens , North Korea can be assessed as being in a state of chronic instability . " <p> When questioned about the potential for coups in North Korea , the minister remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is challenging , if the situation within the country is deteriorating , we can not rule out the possibility of differences of opinion emerging within the power class . " <p> Why has hostility increased ? <p> On Pyongyang designating Seoul as its " primary foe " in January , the minister said internal instability seems to be one of the reasons for the Kim regime pursuing more aggressive policy . <p> " In terms of the internal situation in North Korea , the economic difficulties and food shortages are exceedingly severe . It seems that dissent in public sentiment is emerging within North Korea , " the minister said . <p> During the enlarged meeting of the political bureau of the Party Central Committee held in January , Kim Jong-un openly acknowledged the failure to adequately provide even basic necessities to the people in the provinces as a " grave political issue " that the party and government can never overlook . <p> " In light of the remark , the severity of the economic crisis within North Korea has reached a juncture , prompting attempts to redirect these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , " the minister explained . <p> A significant increase in the popularity of South Korea 's Hallyu within North Korea seems to have made the Kim regime implement policy shifts , as the spread of cultural content may foster " admiration for South Korean society . " <p> " Externally , there appears to be an objective to bolster North Korea 's presence ahead of the upcoming US presidential election , " he said . <p> The minister elucidated that there is also a deliberate emphasis on hostility towards South Korea to reaffirm the legitimacy of North Korea 's pursuit of nuclear development . Additionally , North Korea appears to be seeking justification for a potential nuclear attack on South Korea . <p> Increased provocations <p> The unification minister cautioned against the internal repercussions of Kim Jong-un 's endeavors to nullify the accomplishments of his predecessors , Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il , in inter-Korean relations . <p> These efforts include the demolition of the Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification , established in central Pyongyang in 2001 during the tenure of the late leader Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dismantled the foundation for his own succession by himself . " <p> " There is also the possibility that such changes may lead to ideological confusion and a vacuum within North Korea . We must closely monitor the potential ramifications of abrupt shifts in policies , " he said . <p> " If internal conflicts arise , there is a strong likelihood of military provocations to cover them up , and escalating statements or provocations regarding the NLL appear to be connected to these internal issues . " <p> There is a significant likelihood of North Korea engaging in military provocations ahead of the legislative elections scheduled for April 10 in South Korea , but the possibility of North Korea waging an all-out war would be " extremely difficult . " <p> " Nevertheless , the probability of a local military provocation remains very high . The likelihood of cyber or other hybrid provocations is also significant , " the minister forecast . <p> " The great concern is the potential escalation into war due to miscalculation . " <p> The minister emphasized that South Korea should strengthen its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighting the importance of " peace through strength and peace through deterrence . " <p> " The appropriate response to any threat from North Korea is to adopt a robust deterrence policy . Only then can peace on the Korean Peninsula be upheld . This is why the government is pursuing the 3D policy . " <p> The 3D policy encompasses deterrence , emphasizing the robustness of military capabilities to deter North Korean threats ; dissuasion , discouraging North Korea 's pursuit of missile and nuclear advancements ; and dialogue aimed at achieving denuclearization . <p> Shift in unification policy <p> When asked about whether the precondition for peaceful unification is the collapse of the North Korean regime , the minister emphasized the significance of " empowering " the North Korean people . <p> The Yoon government aims for peaceful unification grounded in the principles of freedom and democracy , as stipulated in Article 4 of South Korea 's Constitution . <p> " The process of unification aims to enhance the autonomy and self-determination of North Korean citizens . It is imperative to make significant efforts to create conditions where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister said . <p> " Ultimately , it seems that the foundation for unification will be laid by promoting North Korean citizens ' freedom and human rights . " <p> The unification minister emphasized that " facilitating the influx of external information into North Korea is currently paramount " to that end . <p> " It 's akin to a chick hatching from an egg ; it requires pecking from the inside as well as delicate tapping from the outside . Ultimately , as the shell cracks , allowing the chick to emerge , efforts from the international community and nongovernmental organizations to increase the flow of information into North Korea must be intensified . " <p> The Unification Ministry 's other main focus is addressing human rights abuses and violations by the Kim Jong-un regime . It has been dedicated to raising awareness of the matter among South Koreans and the international community . <p> Two feasible paths forward <p> In his New Year 's speech , the unification minister likened North Korea to a " windup toy car , " drawing on a metaphor originally coined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for formulating the policy of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War . <p> In 1947 , Kennan stated , " The whole Soviet governmental machine ... moves inexorably along the prescribed path , like a persistent toy automobile wound up and headed in a given direction , stopping only when it meets with some unanswerable force . " <p> According to the minister , Kennan advocated for containment to halt the Soviet Union 's expansion , foreseeing that sustained containment efforts would eventually force the Soviet Union to halt , akin to stopping a clockwork mechanism by leaving it alone until it loses steam . <p> " North Korea is winding up a perilous toy car , propelling it forward through the development of nuclear weapons and missiles , " the minister said . <p> To address this challenge , South Korea must strengthen its military deterrence , enhance coordination with the US and Japan , and employ dissuasion strategies to curb North Korea 's nuclear and missile advancements . <p> Asked about the Kim regime 's sustainability , he suggested that North Korea faces two options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse similar to the Soviet Union . <p> " ( North Korea ) will eventually come forward to the dialogue or come to a halt once it has completely unwound . It 's a matter of one outcome or the other . "

The Avengers : Earth 's Mightiest Heroes had exceptional storytelling , character development , and well-executed adaptations of classic Marvel comic book arcs , including one of the better takes on the Secret Invasion saga . <p> Additionally , the 2-season series from what 2010 successfully captured the essence of iconic Avengers team dynamics while introducing lesser-known characters , like Mockingbird and Abigail Brand , to a wider audience . By bringing back The Avengers : Earth 's Mightiest Heroes , Marvel has the opportunity to reignite fan excitement , delve deeper into the Marvel universe , and continue the legacy of a fan-favourite animated series . <h> 2 ) Marvel 1602 <p> One of the highlights from Season 2 of What If ... ? is the exploration of an Elizabethan era-themed universe in the episode " What If ... the Avengers Assembled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2003 eight-issue comic book limited series , Marvel 1602 , by writer Neil Gaiman , and artist Andy Kubert . <p> The series explores the idea that Marvel superheroes started appearing 400 years earlier , in the year 1602 ( the series was written in 2002 ) for unknown reasons , and its success led to three sequels -- 1602 : New World , Marvel 1602 : Fantastick Four , and Spider-Man : 1602 . The concept holds plenty of promise for a dedicated spin-off , exploring the exploits of familiar heroes in a different setting , including Wanda Merlin and Sir Nicholas Fury , as well as the Merry Men comprising Steve Rogers , Bucky Barnes , and Scott Lang . <h> 3 ) Marvel 2099 <p> Established in 1992 , Marvel 2099 was a Marvel Comics imprint that brought familiar names into a possible future of the Marvel Comics Universe , labelled 2099 . <p> It started with four comic book series -- Doom 2099 , based on Doctor Doom ; Punisher 2099 , based on a new character who adopts the mantle ; Spider-Man 2099 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original Spider-Man ; and Ravage 2099 , an all-new hero . <p> Its initial success led to more books -- 2099 Unlimited , Fantastic Four 2099 , Ghost Rider 2099 , Hulk 2099 , X-Men 2099 , and X-Nation 2099 , a growing concept built upon transporting audiences to a futuristic world where new heroes and villains emerge , from a hacker whose consciousness had been downloaded into a robotic body , to the likes of Vulture 2099 , an insane cannibal who wishes to rule the sky . <p> A few of these characters have made minor appearances in animation over the years , including the more recent debut of Miguel O'Hara 's aka Spider-Man 2099 , voiced by Oscar Isaac , in Spider-Man : Across the Spider-Verse , and there seems to be an appetite by audiences for more .

Envisioned as a raucous and irreverent addition to the superhero animation landscape , the show aimed to capture the same adult-oriented humour that made Archer a hit . Unfortunately , the project hit a snag due to creative differences and never saw the light of day . However , with the success of the Deadpool films and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine on the horizon , perhaps now is the perfect moment to resurrect this tantalising idea . <h> 5 ) Captain America and the Howling Commandos <p> The Howling Commandos , led by the iconic Captain America , are a diverse and dynamic team of soldiers with unique skills and personalities .

With the development of the West Kowloon district as a major cultural hub ... the pivotal role of Hong Kong as a hub for the arts became obvious to the curatorial world on a global scale , ? said Landolt in an interview with finews.asia . <p> ?

Landolt commented . ? While ArtSG established itself as a hub for mostly Southeast Asian art in the region , Hong Kong remains the door for both regional and international art catering for global collectors. ? <p> Chinese Demand <p> As a result of Hong Kong 's developments , combined with the mainland 's post-pandemic rebound , China became the world 's second-largest art market in 2023 , according to a recent UBS report . The growing maturity of the market has led to an increasing mix in demand . <p> ? We see more and more collectors from the Greater China region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese contemporary artist names , but diversify their collections to include international artists of the same league , ? Landolt said . ? At the same time , many collectors who started collecting works of artists focusing on ink as a medium are including more and more non-traditional works in their collections and vice versa. ? <p> Role of Banks <p> While UBS does not engage in art financing , it plays other roles in supporting collectors via its art advisory unit established over 25 years ago . This includes advisory and execution services related to the whole life cycle of clients ' art collections from developing a strategy to reviewing governance . <p> ? As such , we consider art collections in the context of our clients ' overall wealth alongside their entrepreneurial activities , financial assets and other real assets , and advise clients holistically in close collaboration with other in-house specialist teams such as family advisory , philanthropy services and wealth planning , ? said Landolt . <p> Art DNA <p> Beyond advice , UBS also focuses on engagement and connectivity opportunities for clients to link up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ? Art is part of UBS 's DNA , ? Landolt added . ? We hope to inspire our clients and the wider public through the UBS Art Collection , comprising over 30,000 artworks , displayed both in our offices across the globe and on loan in prominent museums , with the mission to continue to support living artists and the art ecosystem as a whole. ?

As a temporary measure , it provided some relief , and helped launch some innovative start-ups . <p> Three years down the line , the government guarantee has expired , and financial institutions are pressing the start-ups and businesses against the wall , demanding guarantees and mortgages to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of government support . Most start-ups are back to square one . And the result -- a high level of non-performing loans and a growing number of business closures . <p> Against this backdrop , it is extremely important how the government spends the Nu 15 billion Economic Stimulus plan , a part of which was recently rolled out . While the stimulus plan , through injection of capital into the economy , will help revitalise the economy and speed up post-pandemic recovery , it is crucial to ensure that investments are directed towards sustainable businesses and start-ups . A thorough review of project proposals and business plans is critical to ensure funds are allocated to ventures with promising growth potential . <p> Above all , for the start-up sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government and financial institutions must embrace a forward-looking strategy that supports start-ups not just in their early stages but throughout their growth journey . This involves building a robust ecosystem that includes access to growth capital and favourable regulations to drive the sector forward . <p> If Bhutan were to become a high-income country by 2034 , it must leverage the private sector and the start-ups as key drivers of economic growth . <p> A transformative approach is the need of the hour -- one that is bold , innovative , and aligned with the evolving needs of the start-up economy .

A44 Games , the creators of 2018 's Ashen , hopes they have an answer with their latest title , Flintlock : The Siege of Dawn . <p> Set in a world inspired by the Napoleonic era , players take on the role of Nor Vanek , a military combat engineer ( or " sapper " ) and member of the coalition . Nor and her comrades are tasked with retaking the titular city of Dawn , where hordes of the undead have poured out of a mysterious gateway to the Great Below known as The Door . When their attempt to seal The Door goes awry , she is separated from her comrades and teams up with Enki , a fox-like creature who possesses otherworldly powers , embarking on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The story is n't groundbreaking by any means , and serves largely as a vessel to propel the gameplay forward . Without an engaging story to keep players invested , it falls to gameplay and combat to carry the experience . Thankfully , what is on offer here is solid -- but not without flaws of its own . Combat wise , the game employs standard souls-like systems such as parrying , perfect dodges and the emphasis on learning an opponent 's attack patterns for openings , but also mixes things up with several unique systems of its own . <p> Apart from standard melee combat , firearms and Enki 's magic play a significant part in the core gameplay loop . As the game 's title implies , Nor uses a pistol ( as well as other guns obtained as the game progresses ) in tandem with her blade to dispatch foes . These firearm attacks not only deal massive damage , but are also able to interrupt an enemy 's strong , unblockable attack , giving players an additional method of countering such attacks instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that firearm attacks consume black powder charges , which is refilled by landing a certain number of melee hits on an enemy . <p> Alas , while the game tries its best to introduce unique gameplay systems to mix up the familiar souls-like experience , poor implementation of said systems and a cookie-cutter premise results in a title that ultimately fails to stand out from the crowd . <p> As Nor 's constant companion , Enki has the ability to curse an enemy with a button press , priming them and allowing Nor 's attacks to fill up a curse bar . Once filled , Nor can perform a flashy critical blow , which can destroy an enemy 's armor or take out a huge chunk of an unarmored enemy 's health . With these gameplay systems combined , combat becomes a dance of cursing an enemy while reacting to attacks and countering with either blade or gun . <p> Wrapping combat up in a neat bow is a rather unique experience point system , which the game dubs as " reputation points " . Behaving in a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily earns a reputation point multiplier for performing combat actions without getting hit and can bank said points with a button press . This ends up becoming a risk and reward gameplay system , where one small mistake can cause players to lose their multiplier completely if they are not careful . Players can spend accumulated reputation points on a number of unlockable skills , as well as upgrades for gear . <p> Despite bringing a number of new ideas to the table , combat does falter a little due to poor implementation . Combat in Flintlock : The Siege of Dawn is animation-locked , which coupled with a relatively slow attack animation speed leads to combat feeling sluggish and unintuitive . Parrying with both melee and ranged weapons feels especially unreliable due to a brief wind-up animation , before entering the actual parry " stance " . In a game where timing is critical for deflecting attacks , this slight delay leads to many instances where taking damage feels unfair . The game also periodically throws hordes of enemies at the player at once , which feels out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control moves are limited , and a single hit removes the multiplier , moments like these can lead to frustration when the player is hit by an attack from off-screen . <p> Unlike most games of the genre , Flintlock : The Siege of Dawn is a much more streamlined experience , evidenced by the games ' take on exploration and traversal . The game is split into various open zones that consist of an obvious " main " path and side paths to find various collectables that can increase health and magic prowess , side quests or resources . The world has a heavy emphasis on verticality , requiring the use of Nor 's double jump and air dash moves to reach new areas . <p> In addition , various skull pedestals litter the world , which when activated allows Nor to fly though the air to reach new locations or open up shortcuts to previous ones . In typical souls-like fashion , checkpoints can be found that allow players to rest and refill their consumables while respawning defeated enemies . But while the game does feature a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games overarching plot in any meaningful way , instead relying on a repetitive formula of fetch quests . In the end , these missions end up as inconsequential to the game 's story , and only exist as a way for players to earn extra bits of loot and experience . <p> This lack of attention to detail is also apparent by an absence of in-engine cutscenes , instead relying on hand-drawn , slideshow-esque bits of lore told from the perspective of an NPC , detailing Nor 's journey from location to location . Much of the game 's storytelling is doled out through the use of static conversations between Nor and the characters she meets along her journey , but uninspired vocal performances make these moments feel as though they were simply shoehorned in , rather than be the result of earnest attempts at proper world-building . <p> Performance-wise , the game includes both a 30fps quality mode and a 60fps performance mode on the PS5 . With a game like this where timing and precision is necessary , a smooth framerate greatly enhances the experience . Thankfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time , with drops to the mid 50 's occurring only during busy scenes , and certain areas of the world such as those with thick vegetation . <p> Visually , the game also lacks any depth beyond the obvious fantastical world setting where gods and demons exist . Instead of filling the landscapes with otherworldly flora , fauna and architecture , the game 's aesthetics feel uninspired and drab . Apart from the opening area which sees Nor fighting in the trenches outside a medieval castle , other areas of the game lack any real identity and while this is not to say that the game looks ugly , the issue here is a lack of environmental diversity , with the game largely consisting of mountainous regions which offer little variety apart from different shades of brown . Enemy controlled forts spread across the map do offer a much-needed change of scenery , but reused textures and environmental props within these locations prevent them from feeling truly unique . <p> Enemy design is also severely lacking , consisting of mostly humanoid archetypes that differ only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highlight , with each sporting a unique look and attack mechanic , but these are too few and far between to leave much of an impact . Ultimately , it feels like there was a missed opportunity here to fill the world with more interesting sights to explore and unique characters to encounter . <p> Fundamentally , the game 's biggest flaw is not that it fails in any particular aspect , but that it does n't excel in any . In a sea of similar titles , nothing is really done here to set it apart from its peers , and the result is an uninspired title that feels largely forgettable once the credits roll . <h> GEEK REVIEW SCORE <p> Summary <p> Despite introducing some new ideas when it comes to combat , Flintlock : The Siege of Dawn ultimately fails to leave an impression , merely offering a perfectly serviceable Souls-like experience for those with that particular itch . <h> Overall <p> Kevin is a reformed PC Master Race gamer with a penchant for franchise " duds " like Darksiders III and Dead Space 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single major game release -- lest his wallet dies trying . <h> We 're geeks , &amp; proud of it ! <p> We are a collective bunch of geeks who love to share our passion with the rest of the world .

@@113627239 <p> After a turbulent few years marked by market volatility , macroeconomic uncertainties , a funding winter , and poor post-IPO performance even among some of the most anticipated tech companies in Southeast Asia , the prospects for the next wave of IPO hopefuls seem promising . <p> Overall , Southeast Asia 's IPO market seems stable , despite the ongoing volatility . In 2023 , there were 163 IPOs , which raised US$5.8 billion . The number of offerings was similar to 2022 , although funds raised were about $1.8 billion less . <p> However , activity in the first quarter of 2024 looks slower than in the same period the year before . And , IPOs in the new-economy sectors in the region have been fewer than in previous years . For instance , the new issuers that raised the most capital in Indonesia , which was the region 's hottest IPO market last year , were energy and mineral companies . <p> Regardless , mature startups in Southeast Asia have been looking to make their market debuts on both regional and global exchanges once the macro environment stabilises . But the road to listing is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all companies ? Following this period of market discipline , what are the other issues , particularly in an overseas listing , that founders need to consider ? <p> As part of a sponsored bespoke event , DealStreetAsia spoke to a panel of experts for their insights : Timothy Pitrelli , Partner at Cooley with extensive experience in public offerings and cross-border transactions globally , but especially in Asia ; Jason Tang , Partner at Marcum Asia who specialises in audit and advisory services for publicly-traded firms in the US ; Hiren Krishnani , Investor Relations and IPO Director , Corporate Platforms , at Nasdaq ; Ross Warner , executive vice president at Piacente Financial Communications who advises companies through the IPO process ; and Justin McCarthy , regional director , Financial Services and Professions Group , Asia , at insurer Aon . <p> The panellists broadly agreed that IPO activity is set to return , with a strong attraction to listings in the US . With that , however , there are significantly more onerous issues for founders to consider , particularly regulatory compliance and investor communications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US market could offer numerous advantages over regional bourses , an overseas listing may not be suitable for every company . In particular , Aon 's McCarthy points to litigation scenarios against which companies need to be adequately insured . <p> Timothy Pitrelli , Partner at Cooley , shared the view that many new economy companies has raised several rounds of capital during the boom years of 2020 and 2021 , and may not need to fundraise further and wait until the IPO markets improve . <p> While waiting for the markets to come back , Ross Warner of Piacente Financial Communications , was of the view that founders use this time to ' stay on investors ' radar screens , even if ( respective companies were ) not reporting significant developments ' . " Think about this as gaining familiarity with your business model , metrics , and the management team , and building trust . Because when the market does turn , and it will turn , you 're going to need to be able to move fast , " he added . <p> The panellists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US investors want access to capital in Southeast Asia . Ten years ago , there was no choice -- you could not invest in Southeast Asia . Now we 've had Sea Group , Grab , Vinfast ; there are plenty of opportunities for US investors to get access to new generation , new emerging market economies , " said Nasdaq 's Hiren Krishnani . <p> Cooley 's Pitrelli highlighted that IPO activity in the US had picked up : " I think it 'll take a little bit of time for that to flow out to Asia , but it 's definitely a trend . So I see a lot of the late-stage companies in Southeast Asia preparing , laying the groundwork , getting their audits , hiring counsel and start thinking through some of the initial work with the hope of a window opening up , perhaps next year , " he added . <p> The following transcript of the discussion has been edited for brevity and clarity . <p> IPOs in the new economy sectors in Southeast Asia have been slower than before . Why is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2021 highs . There are a variety of factors as to why that is : Some of them are macro and some of them are company-specific . <p> Some of the macro factors that have impacted the New Economy IPO market are higher interest rates and geopolitical tensions , but also , frankly , the aftermarket performance at some of the IPOs that have actually happened . All of that has led to an environment where I think investors are more risk-averse . <p> The focus has shifted to companies with profitability , as opposed to rewarding growth-at-any-cost business models . Some new economy businesses have struggled post-pandemic -- once economies opened up and people returned to more in-person , normal activities . <p> The final thing I would note is actually more of a positive factor . Many new economy companies have been able to raise money in the private markets and raised a lot during the boom years of 2020 and 2021 . So they may not need to fundraise and have the benefit of being able to wait until the IPO markets improve . <p> Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitrelli : The good thing is many of these companies have n't gone away . There have n't been many sell-side deals , so the companies that still intend to go public have spent the last two years cutting costs , focusing on financial discipline , and making their businesses healthier . So when they do go public , there 'll be a better company for it . So I am expecting a wave of companies from this region to go public when the market improves . <p> Technically , a company can go public at any time that it chooses . At what stage of a company 's growth should its founders or board consider listing as its next phase ? <p> Jason Tang : Going from a private to a public company has many advantages and disadvantages . It may not be the right decision for every company . <p> Many make decisions on going public based on various factors . Some companies may wait until there is predictability , consistent revenue , or some may wait until the business is mature enough or there 's corporate governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need extra cash to support their growth . <p> So when it comes to making a decision to go public , I typically encourage the management to ask questions , such as does this IPO support your long-term goals , or liquidity needs , or are there any other sources of capital available to support your current stage of development ? Or do you have an experienced professional team in place ? Or are you willing to disclose your operations and strategy to the public ? <p> For overseas listings there are other factors to consider , such as the cost , and compliance with local laws and regulations . It 's very important that the decision-maker thoroughly understands what it takes to be a public company and also selects the right team to help with the process in order to avoid potential hiccups . <p> How relevant , or helpful , would a US listing be for tech startups in Southeast Asia ? <p> Jason Tang : There are a growing number of companies in Southeast Asia , including tech companies , seeking a US listing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available domestically , such as a deep pool of liquidity with an active institutional and retail shareholder base . <p> Most importantly , there 's the flexibility to complete multiple follow-up equity and debt raisings to support the company 's growth . There are other factors such as having a platform to complete future overseas acquisitions and a higher global profile . <p> But that 's not to say that an overseas listing is right for every company . So it 's important that companies make decisions based on their specific needs , to choose the right market when it comes to a public listing . <p> Jason Tang , Partner , Marcum Asia <p> We have about 50 unicorns and about 100 soonicorns . Would you say that Southeast Asia has a substantial pool of IPO-ready companies ? <p> Hiren Krishnani : We believe the entire Southeast Asia market is ripe for IPO activity . The pipeline is increasing from a handful of companies three years ago , to a few dozen today , via traditional IPOs or business combinations SPACs . It 's across all sectors in Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capital in Southeast Asia . Ten years ago , there was no choice -- you could not invest in Southeast Asia . Now we 've had Sea Group , Grab , Vinfast ; there are plenty of opportunities for US investors to get access to new generation , new emerging market economies . <p> Nasdaq has been very successful in the APAC market in general . We 've had about an 86% win rate in 2024 and about 12 deals . It 's a small number at the moment , but we see the pipeline as very strong . There are about 117 F-1 filings in APAC alone . The majority of them are in China , but there are plenty of deals in Southeast Asia as well . In 2023 , we had a 94% win rate in APAC in general . <p> The interesting fact is over the last few years , we 've seen an uptick in international IPOs on NASDAQ , from APAC . So for example , we had 15 IPOs in 2017 and 50 IPOs last year -- three times more . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listings in the region rebound . Are there parallels we can draw to the 3x growth in tech IPOs that we observed in the US after the dot-com bubble ? <p> Hiren Krishnani : This period is very different in that sense , and Wall Street is very scattered with forecasts across a range of outcomes on where monetary policy is headed . Most economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates sometime later this year , but the truth is , nobody knows . The fact remains that we are in a higher interest rate environment , where companies or issuers that are looking to IPO or are ready to , are unable to project the cost of capital in the next few years , and that is a challenge , especially for the high-growth issuers . <p> What we have seen in the market is private company valuations have come down . They have accepted the reality that money is no longer free . With heightened investor scrutiny , and a closer look at valuations , we see that seasoned , scaled , profitable companies or closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and test the market . <p> We expect investor scrutiny on EBITDA , gross margins to remain very high . We also see that more scaled companies , with revenue north of $300 million , with far stronger EBITDA , and stronger balance sheets , will be the first ones to probably test it out . <p> We also anticipate that companies that are private equity-backed will be the first ones to test the market , with stronger balance sheets , lower growth and higher chances of profitability <p> The money raised in 2021 has started to be drawn down . That will push companies to raise capital through an IPO . That 's also a pressure for these issuers . <p> Potential investors need time to truly familiarise themselves with the business models and corporate governance that these companies have . Do you think companies in Southeast Asia that have already expressed their intention to list , but have been holding back for the reasons that we 've spoken about , are sufficiently engaging investors ? <p> Ross Warner : Obviously , it 's company-specific , but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no . If you 're a corporate here , whatever you 're doing , you can probably and should be doing more of it . We 've noticed a tendency among Asia-based companies -- when the market is low , and there 's nothing specific , or significant for them to report -- they tend to lay low . And that 's the wrong attitude to have about this . <p> During the pre-IPO period , you need to stay on investors ' radar screens , even if you 're not reporting significant developments . Think about this as gaining familiarity with your business model , metrics , and the management team , and building trust . Because when the market does turn , and it will turn , you 're going to need to be able to move fast . It 's not a question of when the market turns that you go to the investor base and say ' Hi , do you remember me ? ' View this time now as gaining important feedback , because you may think you know what investors think about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things change all the time . So use this as an important time for gaining feedback . <p> Do n't underestimate the power of your outbound communication strategy during your pre-IPO period . A coordinated strategy that is aligned and reinforces the messages that you want about your company could go a long way towards reinforcing and building the investment community 's understanding and familiarity with your company . <p> How important is it for the company to position itself in investors ' minds in terms of showcasing the right metrics ? <p> Ross Warner : This is deceivingly easy in the minds of most investors , and to get in the big bucket is not so difficult , and your bankers are going to help you with that . But getting into the smaller details is surprising to many corporates . <p> In the pre-IPO phase , you 've got so many metrics that you want to convey to the investment community , and you think all of them are important . But what we 've seen is that many corporates who are in the pre-IPO phase have too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really important , and perhaps they 're going to focus on something that you do n't want them to focus on . <p> We encourage corporates in the pre-IPO period to really hone in on the metrics you want to define your company . Think about looking at a list of metrics on a page and thinking , do these metrics connect and tell the story that I want to have investors focus on ? <p> In getting IPO-ready , to what extent are Southeast Asian tech startups really aware of the obligations and risks related to when a company moves from being private to publicly held ? <p> Justin McCarthy : In Asia , the litigation environment is relatively benign . And entrepreneurs , running businesses , like taking risks . But I think if you 're listing in the US , you face the wrong types of risk -- much more active regulators , you have shareholders who are much more aware of their rights . <p> There are about 450 , 000 law firms and 1.3 million lawyers in the US , and unfortunately , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing those against companies . That 's underpinned by the legislation there . So there 's the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . Those acts are there to protect investors against alleged misstatements and fraud within the securities markets . <p> There 's a company called Cornerstone Research that publishes data on class actions . There were some 83 class actions last year , which were settled , and that came to $3.9 billion in settlements . The average settlement was $47 million , and the median settlement was $15 million . <p> To put that in context : About 50% of those sorts of claims are probably going to be kicked out of a court , so it wo n't come to that . But it does just show the potential size of litigation against companies and the need to be really prepared . Being prepared will help avoid those issues , and if they do , I would want to make sure that their insurance programs are in place to protect them . <p> ESG compliance and standards have been a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that level of focus on ESG for companies in Southeast Asia , even as it has become an issue of risk . How do you see this from a risk assessment perspective ? <p> Justin McCarthy : The focus will still be more on the financials of the company , but insurers will be looking to see how companies assess their ESG risks and how they communicate to stakeholders . And they 're doing that more , seeing that there 's proper management , and it reflects well on them , but at the moment , it 's not really a key risk . There are certain insurers that will give you a break on your premium because you 've got good ESG records , but that 's still something that 's developing . <p> What are the trade-offs or differences between going public through a SPAC , or a traditional IPO ? <p> Timothy Pitrelli : Whatever IPO structure you choose , you just need to make sure it achieves your goal . <p> Some companies or founders and shareholders believe that a de-SPAC is a quicker , easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuation . I can talk for a long time about how the reality of the current de-SPAC market does not reflect the reality of that misconception . Oftentimes , it takes longer , it 's more expensive , and there are a variety of drawbacks , but it could fit your objectives in terms of going public , so it 's worth considering . <p> There are three key drawbacks that come to mind about doing a de-SPAC , as opposed to a traditional IPO . <p> The first key drawback of a de-SPAC relative to a traditional IPO is the lack of certainty of funds and the dilutive impact the SPAC could have . If your goal is to raise funds , then you actually do n't know how much of the SPAC trust will actually end up redeeming , and redemption rates have been extremely high , in some cases , 90-plus percent . <p> So if you 're doing a SPAC IPO and looking at what 's in trust , just know that it is possible that money may disappear . Also , in this market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private investment in public equity ) , or other third-party financings , at reasonable terms . Some of these structures have been very onerous , and highly diluted . <p> The second key drawback is you wo n't have underwriters . You 're saving the cost of not having underwriters , but there are certain services that underwriters provide that are very helpful to companies in a traditional IPO . These include roadshows and testing of the waters where you 're engaged in broad-based , investor education about your business , and creating an understanding of your business in your future investor pool , but who may also do secondary trading in the market . Also bookbuilding and price discovery -- which gives you some control over which investors you allocate to in an IPO ; and stabilisation activities after listing , that in a traditional IPO , stabilisation helps avoid volatility in the stock price in the weeks post-listing . <p> The final drawback is you have to then overcome a perception in the market that has developed , that de-SPAC companies are companies that were not ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwriters conducting due diligence and advisors delivering the usual opinions . That 's not insurmountable ; you can overcome that through good reporting and good governance after listing . But unfortunately , I think there has been that perception that has developed in the market for some de-SPAC companies . <p> For a listing in the US , preparing US GAAP or IFRS financials , and PCAOB-complaint audits can often be among the steepest challenges that companies in Southeast Asia . How do you drive the messaging to potential clients ? <p> Jason Tang : The quality and experience of the professional team that is selected are very important because an experienced financial consulting team and auditors can help you make the right decisions in navigating through the process , including whether you choose US GAAP or IFRS for financial statements , or to prepare technical memos in the areas of income tax or accounting issues ; or to execute an efficient audit plan , or put out accurate disclosures . <p> It 's vital for the company to choose a professional team with a proven track record and deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need experienced auditors to help you make sure there is no accounting issue that is subject to scrutiny . <p> What are the key geographies or industries in Southeast Asia where companies may favour a US listing over a domestic one , and why ? <p> Hiren Krishnani : Most companies belong and believe in the local market ; they should believe in the local market . But each year , each country will have companies that may choose to look outside . And when they do , we think Nasdaq is the best place they can choose because of the life sciences solutions , investor relations , ESG and corporate governance . <p> For the world 's most dynamic and fast-growing companies , US markets remain the undisputed home for listing and trading shares . We 've seen an uptick in those international companies looking at exploring a listing on exchanges in the US , either a primary listing or switching to a US primary listing from this region . <p> This is for various reasons , but primarily driven by the valuation gap , and also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this region is looking at their peers , they feel that they may miss out on with a valuation gap , and that will be a big disadvantage . An interesting fact also is that companies in the US who 've chosen the US exchange , have had four times more capital raised than the ones that chose a listing in Europe . <p> If we were to look at things from an investor 's perspective , to what extent do US investors see the value of portfolio diversification that Southeast Asia and India provide , perhaps as a counterweight to China ? <p> Hiren Krishnani : For international companies looking to gain access to US investors , NASDAQ has the single deepest securities capital market in the world , and it 's supported by highly sophisticated institutional investors . We 're also recognized by local companies and investors alike as a gold standard at home with the world 's most innovative , growth-oriented companies across all sectors . <p> Companies which choose to list on NASDAQ also get access to indexes like NASDAQ-100 or the Nasdaq Next Generation-100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunities for companies . And we offer companies lifecycle solutions such as ESG , investor relations , and corporate governance , but also our tremendous corporate branding , thought leadership , networking events , curated events on our markets side , and also the NASDAQ Center for Board Excellence . <p> So would one way of drawing more Southeast Asian companies to list in the US be through dual-listings ? <p> Hiren Krishnani : Not many people know that we work very closely with the local stock exchanges . We run the technology for stock exchanges globally , including SGX and all of the ASEAN exchanges . All of the settlement matching engine is done by Nasdaq . We have a dual-listing partnership with SGX , we have a data partnership ; we run the IR , the governance . We work very closely with all of the local stock exchanges , and it 's to the benefit of issuers , to give them that flexibility , if they want to consider a dual listing , that exchanges are working together to support that . <p> What are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies should look to implement as they get IPO-ready ? <p> Ross Warner : It does n't matter the size of your IPO -- going from a private to a public company is hard , and there are a lot of things for management to get their minds wrapped around . But one of the biggest things , in terms of communication is , if you 're a private company , start communicating like a listed company , before you become a listed company . <p> Recognise that as a private company , you have a lot of leeway in what you say in your outbound communications to the market . Once you become a listed company , that all changes . You 're under the microscope of the media , regulators , and investors . So be very , very aware that what you did before , that made you successful in communication , you might not be able to do now as a listed company . <p> Now , one of the ways to put that through to the rank and file for the companies is through training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with IR , PR , and marketing firms and understanding pre-IPO disclosure regulations around communications , publicity and marketing . One of the highest risk times for outbound communication that a company will have is in the pre-IPO phase . <p> We then move on to helping marketing and PR departments understand what it means to be a listed company and under fair disclosure regulations -- what you can say and what you ca n't say . Getting all of this in place ahead of time reduces the risk of any blow-ups once you are listed . <p> As companies plan a listing , how important is it for them to evaluate their insurance programmes well , and consider whether they 're adequately protected against the risks that come with being a public company ? <p> Justin McCarthy : I think the risk of being sued as a public company is much greater . So you need to really reassess what you have . What you might have here in Asia will be fairly cheap . When you move to the US it wo n't be . A couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 million in insurance cover . It 's come down since then , but it 's still much more expensive . And the type of insurers who are built to provide that coverage may be different to the one you have here in Asia . <p> Companies should look at cyber insurance as well . There was a report out of the FBI in November last year saying that ransomware attacks are focusing on significant financial events such as IPOs , and M&amp;A deals . These ransomware attackers are focusing on companies prior to this and threatening to expose sensitive information ahead of the events unless a ransom is paid . So make sure you have insurance in place to address that . <p> If you have a ransomware attack , on average for a public company in the US , the share price drops by 20% . It recovers pretty quickly . But as ransomware becomes more sophisticated , the length of time that interruption is on for is increasing as well . So if you 've got disgruntled shareholders who look to hold the board accountable for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage that , which can help reduce that risk . <p> An IPO can be an ideal outcome for many companies . But in truth , only a handful of companies get there . Is a trade sale or merger perhaps the best option for some of the more successful tech startups here ? <p> Timothy Pitrelli : An M&amp;A sale provides a complete exit for your shareholders at an agreed M&amp;A valuation , but you remain a private company . You can avoid the reporting and compliance burden and costs of being a public company . But you do n't have access to public markets to fundraise and invest in the future growth of your business . You may not care about that , because the buyer may be well-capitalised or themselves have access to financing that they 're willing to invest in the target . <p> An IPO gives a partial exit to your shareholders . Most IPOs are primary only , and pre-IPO shareholders are locked down for six months , which means they can only sell down , not all usually , but a portion after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profile . It allows you to access the public markets for future financings to invest in the business . On the flip side , you 're a public company , and subject to reporting and compliance obligations . <p> It really depends on what you 're looking to achieve and what will be the best outcome for your business and your shareholders . <p> There is a third option : Running a dual-track process . We 've done this for companies based in Asia -- and that is running an IPO and a sell-side M&amp;A process in parallel . You can get some price indication from both the IPO investors and the potential M&amp;A buyers , and later in the process before you flip public on your IPO , you can decide which path you 're going to choose . If done correctly , that allows you to maximise the certainty of your transaction because even if IPO markets are soft , you could pivot to the M&amp;A . It also allows you to achieve , maybe , the best price because you can choose which track is giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's running two deals at once -- with higher costs and time commitment from the company it requires a lot of resources to do correctly . <p> Timothy Pitrelli , Partner , Cooley <p> We 're seeing some companies whose roots are in China position themselves as Singapore companies , even as a big part of their talent remains on the mainland . Do you see many of these Chinese-founded but technically Singapore companies using the city-state as a base to go public ? <p> Jason Tang : Due to the growing geopolitical tension between the US and China in recent years , and also the growing trend of Chinese tech giants venturing outside China , we will see the unicorns move their headquarters to Singapore , and may potentially use Singapore as their base for future listings . I believe this trend will continue especially due to Singapore 's friendly business environment , tax advantages , and cultural similarity for Chinese companies . <p> Can Southeast Asia tech companies listing in the US take the place of Chinese companies ? <p> Hiren Krishnani : We 've had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On average , we get about 30 to 35 listings each year from China , so that 's a significant market for us . About 20% of listings on NASDAQ are international companies . What happened last year was a bit of uncertainty about the general procedure of doing IPOs for Chinese companies , and there was a bit of a slowdown that happened . But I think there 's a lot more clarity now about what companies need to do , though the process is much longer . <p> But we do see a trend where a lot of Chinese companies set up their base in Singapore though their business is primarily China-driven , but they 're looking to tackle the Southeast Asian market . <p> With increasing investor attention on ESG practices and compliance , how should smaller companies preparing for a listing address them , given that it can be quite an onerous process ? And how much weight should they put on it as part of their IPO story ? Or is it only the larger companies that can afford to tell their story ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see a lot of interest from investors coming to Asia asking about ESG . Or if we did , it was very light , and it only focused on the ' G ' governance . But about 18 months ago , that all changed . We saw a huge increase in interest among investors asking about ESG , and even asking to meet with sustainability committees . <p> For a smaller company , we see this as a golden opportunity to stand out in the IPO process . It 's a way to differentiate yourself and to elevate management in the eyes of investors that you are thinking about the operations of your company as a whole . So this would be something that we would strongly consider that corporates weave into their IPO strategy , in their communication , to really stand up and to elevate because right now , not many small companies are doing so . <p> What are your projections for the coming year ahead , in terms of your respective sectors ? <p> Hiren Krishnani : So we 've recently launched the IPO Pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IPOs that are going to come this year . <p> Market data and investor sentiment suggests that the IPO environment is positive and should remain steady in 2024 . We had a bit of an uptick in Q1 when we saw about 40 IPOs in the US . And we certainly see bigger IPOs coming . <p> What we need to see is IPOs doing well . Nobody wants to be the first one to go out ; they want to follow others and we need to see the performance of those IPOs , and that 's when the market will really open up . What I can share publicly is there are 90 filings with NASDAQ at the moment , and that 's probably the highest we 've ever had . <p> Ross Warner : What 's changing for IR professionals in the market right now is the advent of artificial intelligence ( AI ) . This has tremendous potential to revolutionise our industry . But particularly for IR financial communications , it 's a particularly risky tool to use . <p> We know that approximately 80% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI , but yet only 5% or less than 5% of the companies have usage policy on this . This is tremendously risky , because there are closed AI systems and open AI systems , and not many companies have a closed system . So that means that most IR officers are using an open system , which means that potentially sensitive data is being put out there . <p> So if you 're a corporate , what we would suggest you do is educate , educate , educate . Make first and foremost the use case scenarios that you will allow for IR to use with AI , and also the tools for AI that you would use ; the potential unleashed for data synthesis , in particular for streamlining workflows , is going to be tremendous . <p> Jason Tang : I see many companies in Southeast Asia looking to list in the US . <p> Companies just need to be prepared ; it is important they can articulate clearly their unit economics and their strategy to drive expansion and to communicate their vision of the future that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clear milestones and also whether an IPO helps to enter a new market . It 's also important for the management to have experienced and quality independent professionals to be able to help with that . With those in place , then I think there 's a definitely sizable pipeline of IPO-ready companies . <p> Timothy Pitrelli : IPO activity in the US has picked up , including in new economy companies . I think it 'll take a little bit of time for that to flow out to Asia , but it 's definitely a trend . So I see a lot of the late-stage companies in Southeast Asia preparing , laying the groundwork , getting their audits , hiring counsel and start thinking through some of the initial work with the hope of a window opening up , perhaps next year . But it takes six to eight months , maybe even longer , to actually do an IPO . So if you want to be ready to do one , sometime in the middle of next year , you 're going to need to be thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , in order to be ready for when that window comes .

Iswaran faces 35 charges , including 32 counts of obtaining valuables , two counts of corruption , and one count of obstructing justice . <p> The former PAP Member for Parliament for West Coast GRC faces a total of 35 charges . <p> These include 32 counts of obtaining valuables as a public servant , two counts of corruption , and one count of obstructing justice . <p> The charges are linked to his interactions with property tycoon Ong Beng Seng and Lum Kok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The charges against Iswaran involve alleged dealings with Mr Ong , including the receipt of various items such as tickets to the Singapore Formula One ( F1 ) Grand Prix , football matches , and musical shows in Britain . <p> Mr Ong , credited with bringing the F1 race to Singapore , is also the chairman of race promoter Singapore GP . The prosecution alleges that these transactions , worth approximately S$218,058.95 , were influenced by Iswaran 's role as Chairman of the F1 Steering Committee . <p> Additionally , Iswaran is accused of receiving valuable items such as bottles of whisky , golf clubs , and a Brompton bicycle from Mr Lum , with a combined value of approximately S$18,956.94 . <p> These items were allegedly received while Mr Lum was overseeing the T315 contract , which involved addition and alteration works to the Tanah Merah Station and viaducts under Lum Chang Building Contractors and the Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) . <p> Earlier , Iswaran successfully petitioned to have his charges heard in a joint trial rather than separately . <p> If convicted of obtaining valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison sentence of up to two years , a fine , or both . <p> Conviction under the Prevention of Corruption Act for corruptly obtaining gratification could result in a sentence of up to seven years in prison , a fine of up to S$100,000 , or both . <p> Additionally , if convicted of obstructing justice , Iswaran could be sentenced to up to seven years in prison , a fine , or both . <h> S. Iswaran loses bid for witness statements disclosure for third time <p> On 3 September , former PAP Minister S. Iswaran 's third attempt to compel the prosecution to disclose all witness statements failed . The defence , represented by Davinder Singh Chambers , argued that Section 214(1) ( d ) of the Criminal Procedure Code requires the prosecution to disclose all witness statements , including drafts . However , Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Woo Bih Li and Steven Chong , struggling to follow Mr Singh 's argument , dismissed Iswaran 's bid , stating the questions were not of law of public interest . <p> SINGAPORE : On Tuesday ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third attempt to compel the prosecution to provide all witness statements to the defence was unsuccessful . <p> The 62-year-old former minister from the People 's Action Party sought permission to refer two related legal questions of public interest to the Court of Appeal : whether the prosecution is required to include witness statements as part of its case , and whether the court can order the prosecution to do so . <p> According to the CPC , the prosecution must serve the defense with its case before the trial begins . This includes conditioned statements that the prosecution intends to admit at trial -- written statements admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings . <p> The prosecution interpreted this to mean it only needs to provide conditioned statements of witnesses it plans to admit at trial . <p> However , Senior Counsel Davinder Singh and his team contended that the prosecution should also provide all forms of witness statements , including " draft statements , " that it intends to use . <p> In dismissing Iswaran 's bid , Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon , Justice Woo Bih Li and Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not constitute questions of public interest law . <p> As reported by CNA , during the hearing , Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justice Steven Chong expressed difficulty in understanding Mr Davinder Singh 's arguments . Justice Chong questioned the admissibility of draft statements , stating that it is impossible to intend to admit such drafts . <p> Both justices repeatedly indicated they were struggling to follow Mr Singh 's interpretation of Section 214(1) ( d ) of the Criminal Procedure Code . <p> Chief Justice Menon challenged Mr Singh 's reading , suggesting that it would require the prosecution to include all witness statements -- whether signed or in draft form -- when filing their case , even if the prosecution did not currently intend to use them at trial . <p> Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon questioned whether Mr. Singh 's interpretation required the inclusion of all conceivable evidence , regardless of its relevance at the time of filing . <p> Mr Singh agreed , explaining that the intention to admit evidence can be formed or withdrawn at any time . He argued that the law should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mr Singh recalled that on 2 April , the prosecution asked the defence to consent to conditioned statements being filed without allowing them to see those statements first . <p> " So our position was -- you can show us those statements before you ask us to consent . When we took that position , that we are entitled to see them before we would agree or not they changed their position and said we are not filing conditioned statements . " <p> " So whatever one might make out of that , the point is intention is a moving target , " said Mr Singh . <p> Chief Justice Menon acknowledged Mr Singh 's points but expressed concern that the language of Section 214(1) ( d ) of the statute is not flexible or a " moving target . " <p> " The language of the statute was chosen by the parliament and it constrains what the court can order , " Chief Justice told Mr Singh . <p> " And to be honest with you , Mr Singh , if I can cut to the chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interpretation of Section 214(1) ( d ) , I 'm struggling to see how we can sustain those contentions within the language of 214 . " <p> He also questioned where the statutory basis could be found to support the broader scope of discovery that Mr. Singh was advocating for . <p> Mr Singh then argued that his client has fewer rights under the current criminal disclosure regime , which replaced the previous committal hearing provisions . <p> He suggested that his client now has less access to the prosecution 's evidence . <p> However , Justice Steven Chong countered that this argument was " not a realistic one " , noting that the prosecution would disadvantage itself by not admitting certain statements . <p> Chief Justice Menon further pointed out that Mr Singh was essentially asking the court to effectively craft a discovery regime " similar to what existed under the old committal hearings , which is problematic because Parliament had not addressed it . <p> He clarified that Parliament intended for the new criminal disclosure regime , outlined in Section 214 , to specify what the prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution intends to admit at trial . <h> Trial for former Transport Minister S Iswaran to begin on September 10 <p> Mr Iswaran was last in open court in July , where he lost his bid to compel the prosecution to make available to the defence all statements by prosecution witnesses . <p> The former PAP Member for Parliament for West Coast GRC faces a total of 35 charges .

@@114340235 <p> Around 20 per cent of firms in Singapore are foreign-owned , yet they employ 60 per cent of residents in high-earning jobs , according to the Ministry of Manpower ( MOM ) . <p> Data released on 17 September 2024 shows that these positions pay over S$12,500 per month , placing workers in the top 10 per cent of income earners . <p> MOM emphasized the importance of foreign investments in driving business growth and improving the local job market . In the second quarter of 2024 , foreign firms employed nearly one-third of the resident workforce , underscoring their critical role in Singapore 's labour market . <p> These foreign-owned firms -- defined as having less than 50 per cent local equity -- also create opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , which hire the majority of resident workers -- which comprises Singaporean and Permanent Resident workers . <p> Dr Tan See Leng , Minister for Manpower , highlighted the impact of foreign firms in a Facebook post on 17 September : " Foreign-owned firms comprise around 20% of companies in Singapore and provide jobs for nearly one-third of employed residents .

Despite multiple attempts by Mr Giam to obtain precise figures , Dr Tan did not provide specific data on how many Singaporeans were employed in PMET roles compared to foreign workers . <h> Minister Deflects Specifics on PMET Employment <p> When Mr Giam reiterated his request for details on how many PMET jobs went to Singaporeans , Dr Tan shifted the focus to Singapore 's low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in resident employment among advanced economies . He noted that Singapore 's resident employment rate of 66.2 per cent and long-term unemployment rate of 0.8 per cent were among the lowest globally . <p> Dr Tan explained that the influx of foreign workers was necessary to meet the demands of a growing economy , particularly in sectors facing significant talent shortages . <p> He argued that attracting foreign talent and investments helps businesses thrive , which in turn creates jobs for Singaporeans . However , he did not directly address Mr Giam 's core question about how many of the new PMET positions were filled by Singaporeans , leaving the matter unresolved . <p> Mr Giam countered that the 4,900 jobs created for residents in 2023 covered the entire workforce , not just PMET roles . He expressed concerns that the government 's extensive investments and incentives to attract multinational companies ( MNCs ) might disproportionately benefit foreign workers over Singaporeans . <h> MOM 's Focus on Foreign Talent <p> In his response , Dr Tan emphasized that Singapore must remain open to foreign talent to sustain economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . <p> He rejected the notion of a " zero-sum game " between local and foreign workers , arguing that businesses need access to both local and foreign talent to remain competitive .

Resident employment , which includes Singaporeans and permanent residents , declined by 600 . <p> According to the Labour Market Report for Q2 2024 , released by Singapore 's Ministry of Manpower ( MOM ) , total employment increased by 11,300 jobs in the second quarter . However , non-resident workers accounted for all of this growth , while resident employment -- comprising both Singaporeans and permanent residents -- declined by 600 . <p> The job growth was largely driven by Work Permit holders in Construction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the lower wages and physically demanding conditions , especially in light of Singapore 's rising cost of living . <p> Despite ongoing efforts to boost resident employment , structural challenges remain . The MOM report noted that residents are generally not keen to take up these lower-paying , labor-intensive jobs , leading to a continued reliance on non-residents for filling such roles . <p> Underemployment and Retrenchment Challenges <p> The report also highlighted a slight rise in time-related underemployment among residents , from 1.9% in Q1 2024 to 2.2% in Q2 2024 . This refers to residents who are employed part-time but would prefer to work more hours , indicating some level of job dissatisfaction or mismatch between available opportunities and their needs for full-time work . <p> Retrenchments increased from 3,030 in Q1 2024 to 3,270 in Q2 , with Professionals , Managers , Executives , and Technicians ( PMETs ) and older workers among the most affected . More than half ( 55.0% ) of residents retrenched in Q4 2023 managed to find new jobs within six months . However , a significant portion of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents who were re-employed , 41.4% had to settle for jobs that paid less than their previous roles . This figure is derived from the fact that 58.6% of re-employed residents managed to secure jobs with the same or higher wages . Therefore , the remaining 41.4% took up jobs with reduced pay . <p> Even more concerning is that only 32.2% of all retrenched residents were able to find jobs with wages comparable to or better than their previous positions . This figure is derived from the re-employment rate ( 55.0% ) multiplied by the proportion of those who secured similar or higher wages ( 58.6% ) , highlighting that less than one-third of retrenched workers ended up in roles offering similar financial compensation . <p> Re-Employment Struggles for Older Workers <p> Older workers , particularly those aged 40 and above , faced even greater challenges . The re-employment rate for residents aged 40 to 49 dropped from 60.6% in Q1 to 54.4% in Q2 . For workers aged 50 to 59 , the re-employment rate saw a sharp decline from 52.8% to 41.6% , indicating that older workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also more likely to accept jobs with lower pay . <p> This situation reflects broader trends where older workers often struggle to match their previous earnings when transitioning to new jobs , contributing to financial strain , especially given Singapore 's high cost of living . <p> Non-Resident Employment Drives Growth <p> Non-resident employment increased by 12,000 in Q2 2024 , mainly driven by Work Permit holders in Construction and Manufacturing . These sectors continue to rely heavily on non-residents for jobs that residents are generally unwilling to take up due to the nature and wages of the roles . Resident employment saw some growth in outward-oriented sectors such as Financial &amp; Insurance Services , Information &amp; Communications , and Professional Services , but these gains were outweighed by seasonal declines in Retail Trade and Administrative &amp; Support Services , resulting in a net decline in resident employment . <p> The MOM report did not distinguish between Singapore citizens and permanent residents , so it is unclear how each group was specifically impacted . However , the fact that non-residents accounted for all job growth suggests continued challenges in attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Job Vacancies <p> The labour market remained tight in Q2 2024 , with the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons increasing from 1.56 in March 2024 to 1.67 in June 2024 . Job vacancies held steady at 81,200 , while unemployment rates improved slightly . The overall unemployment rate fell to 2.0% , and the resident unemployment rate dropped to 2.7% , with long-term unemployment among residents remaining low at 0.8% . <p> Despite the high number of job vacancies , the declining re-employment rates among retrenched older workers and rising underemployment rates indicate ongoing difficulties in matching available jobs to residents ' skills and wage expectations . <p> Impact of Foreign Workforce Policies <p> The MOM report also reflects the impact of foreign workforce policies aimed at raising the quality and standards of non-resident workers . Declines in Employment Pass ( EP ) and S Pass holders were seen in several sectors , in line with government efforts to raise qualifying salaries and reduce reliance on foreign workers for mid-skilled positions . <p> However , the continued growth in non-resident employment , particularly among Work Permit holders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles that residents are not willing or able to take up , especially in sectors offering lower wages . <p> SINGAPORE : Associate Professor Jamus Lim , Workers ' Party Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC , has offered his take on the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme ( JSS ) , which he describes as the People 's Action Party 's ( PAP ) equivalent of unemployment insurance . <p> The JSS , unveiled with more details during Prime Minister Lawrence Wong 's National Day Rally speech on 18 August , has sparked comparisons with the Workers ' Party 's own long-standing proposal for redundancy insurance ( RI ) , first introduced in its 2006 manifesto . <p> In a 12 September Facebook post , Assoc Prof Lim emphasised that the WP had been advocating for a redundancy insurance scheme for almost two decades , providing substantial details on it in their 2016 policy paper . <p> " We 've been thinking about the issue for a while now , " Lim stated , adding that the WP 's proposal has been part of global best practices for advanced economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PAP 's argument that the JSS is not unemployment insurance . <p> He pointed out that the differences the PAP cites -- such as JSS being tied to job-seeking conditions and funded from general revenue rather than payroll taxes -- are inconsequential . <p> " Tax revenue is fungible , so it all comes from the people anyway , " Assoc Prof Lim explained . <p> He argued that funding the scheme from general revenue might even make it less equitable , as it could potentially shift the burden onto non-workers to subsidise workers . <p> The Workers ' Party 's version of redundancy insurance , Assoc Prof Lim highlighted , envisioned a shared responsibility between employers , employees , and the government to ensure fairness and sustainability . <p> " We do believe in tripartism , " he remarked , underscoring that society should bear the responsibility for protecting its workers . <p> One of the central points in Assoc Prof Lim 's critique was that tying financial support to job-seeking efforts is standard in unemployment schemes globally , including in Singapore . <p> He acknowledged concerns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fears exaggerated . <p> " Most people , even in the West , do find value and meaning in some form of work , " he noted . <p> In discussing the design of unemployment insurance systems , Assoc Prof Lim pointed to the importance of balancing the duration of support with the amount provided . <p> While too long a tenure or too large a payout could discourage a return to the workforce and allow skills to erode , too little would leave workers struggling to cover household expenses during critical periods . <p> The WP 's redundancy insurance proposal included a payout of 40% of the last drawn income for up to six months , which Lim described as a " **34;3223;TOOLONG " sum . <p> Although this amount is lower than what is typically found in advanced economies , and the duration is shorter than the OECD average of one year , he highlighted that it reflects Singapore 's shorter unemployment spells of around two months .

@@114978236 <p> Industry analyst Josh Bersin has been working in the HR tech industry for two decades -- during which time there has been tremendous disruption . <p> " But I have never seen this market change so fast in such as positive way , " Bersin told the audience at Wednesday morning 's keynote address at the HR Tech Conference in Las Vegas . <p> The forces for change are vast : dropping birthrates mean organisations will be operating with fewer people , an " activated " workforce that has heightened the focus on employee experience -- but perhaps none more than the rapid evolution of AI . <p> " AI will be one of the most important technologies to address the issues of the labour market , employee experience , employee reskilling -- all the things we 're seeing right now in business , " Bersin said . He told the conference crowd that the many AI-infused systems they are seeing on the floor of the show 's Expo Hall are not just the " fancy tools " AI products used to be . <p> AI is meaningfully " touching " every area of HR : recruiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career mobility , rewards , and more . <p> " They 're not just cool things that are fun to buy and look at , " he said . " AI tools are business imperatives that we 're going to have to adopt . " <p> Four ways AI will transform HR tech in 2025 <p> The development of AI is among the factors that have led to a proliferation in the HR tech market : In just the last three years , the average number of employee-facing apps a large organisation deploys has jumped 57% -- to 93% . Increasingly , employers will need to " stitch together " tools in a systemic way , leveraging AI to deliver a more frictionless employee experience while driving business outcomes . <p> Bersin offered a number of predictions about how AI -- once " permeating " the HR tech stack and now " dominating " it -- will shape the HR tech landscape in the coming year . <p> Agentic AI <p> As AI-powered chatbots were introduced into HR systems in the last few years , they gave employees new access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shoulders of HR professionals . Now , we are seeing the market progress towards AI agents , Bersin . <p> For instance , whereas an HR chatbot of the past may have been able to answer an employee 's question about how much vacation time they have , an AI agent can put that information into action -- walking them through putting in for time off , or booking flights or hotels . <p> Agents will be introduced and integrated across HR systems , Bersin predicted . <p> " It 's a huge transition in the market , " he said . " All AI systems are going to start talking to each other , and you 'll be able to conduct transitions in core systems and across systems . " <p> The emergence of agentic AI is already making headlines : Workday and Oracle are among the HCM organisations that recently unveiled new agentic AI capabilities . <p> " This is going to be a really interesting war of agents , " Bersin said . <p> A consolidated employee experience <p> Bersin cited research that found 87% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . This number one priority ? Employee experience . <p> Employees today are " activated " -- they know they have options in the job market , and they are empowered to voice their needs . And that means that , when it comes to tech , " they simply will not use the stuff they do not like , " Bersin said . <p> Agentic AI will be a game-changer for elevating employees ' tech experience , he predicted . <p> " All of the experience stuff is going to be done with an agent . But we do n't want 20 agents , " he said . " The next big initiative is going to be how to decide where to use Galileo , Microsoft Copilot , the copilots from Workday or Eightfold -- how will those all fit together ? " <p> Over time , he said , many of these agents will learn to " talk to one another under the covers " , alleviating some of those integration decisions from HR professionals . <p> " It 's a very hot space because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bersin said . <p> A revolution for L&amp;D <p> AI is also primed to disrupt learning and development -- a massive , US$320 billion market , with hundreds of content providers . <p> " AI is going to upset the whole apple cart , " Bersin said . <p> How ? In the last decade , since the introduction of the learning experience platform , there have not been a lot of learning tools hitting the market . <p> " Now we have AI , and we have just unleashed a whole new way of thinking about this , " Bersin said . A market evolution is happening " very , very fast " , Bersin said -- and in the coming year , he predicted legacy systems will integrate with agents and assistants . <p> " These things are going to come together , and we 'll see the LMS market reinvented by new AI-driven tools , " he said . <p> Content providers will be particularly disrupted and need to " rethink " how they deliver content , he advised . <p> At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to see an influx of intelligent AI coaches in the coming months . <p> " They 're immature right now but there 's no question , based on my experience with AI , that is going to happen -- and we 're going to have a lot of very cool AI coaching interfaces , " he said . <p> " The fact that talent acquisition is one of the most important areas of HR is because it 's perhaps the most important thing HR does in your organisation , " he said . " If you do n't hire the right people , all the other stuff is so much harder to do . " <p> As much as AI and automation will be used to shrink hiring cycle times , for instance , Bersin said , the need for " the human aspects remains " . <p> The recruiter , he said , will continue to be one of the " most important roles " in HR -- and one whose work will shift . <p> Strategically minded organisations are transforming their talent acquisition units from operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more of a strategic , forward-facing function " . As tech takes over some of the TA processes , it will empower TA professionals to ask those questions that only humans can : Why are we hiring this person ? Is an internal candidate a better fit ? How can we redesign work to reduce the need for this person ? Should we reskill people ? <p> It is not a transformation that is yet widespread : Recent Josh Bersin Co research found that 70% of TA leaders said these were discussions they were not yet leading -- they are still " just cranking out jobs and getting people in the door as fast as possible .

" <p> To eventually eradicate Malaysia 's brain drain problem , organisations must also cultivate a sustainable culture of continuous learning in the workplace , which can present daunting challenges , acknowledged Dr Muru . <p> These include the need to balance productivity with learning , with organisations having to integrate learning into daily work schedules and set productivity targets that include time for learning activities . <p> It can also be challenging to quantify the return on investment ( ROI ) of learning and development programmes in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To overcome this , develop metrics that are aligned with business objectives , such as increased sales , improved customer satisfaction scores , or reduced error rates , " he said , " Conduct pre- and post-training assessments to track improvements in employee performance and productivity .

" <p> Encouraging participation is another challenge , as some employees may be hesitant to engage in learning activities due to perceived time constraints , lack of motivation , or uncertainty about the relevance of training to their roles . <p> In such instances , organisations can offer incentives such as certifications , badges , or recognition programmes for completing modules or achieving learning milestones . <p> " They can also provide personalised learning paths tailored to individual career goals and interests , communicate the value of continuous learning through leadership endorsement , showcase success stories of employees who have benefited from training , and highlight career advancement opportunities linked to skill development , " said Dr Muru . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their careers , embracing change is non-negotiable , suggested Dr Muru . <p> " Some employees may resist acquiring new skills or adapting to changes in job requirements due to fear of failure , comfort with existing routines , or scepticism about the benefits of learning .

They should also seek mentorship or coaching from colleagues or supervisors who can provide guidance and encouragement during periods of transition or skill acquisition . <p> However , learning new skills is only effective when employees can successfully apply them in real-world situations and derive tangible benefits for themselves and their organisation , reminded Dr Muru . <p> " Employees can ensure the practical application of new skills by volunteering for cross-functional projects or task forces that require the use of newly acquired skills , and seek feedback from supervisors , peers , or mentors on performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For more news and analysis on the latest HR and workforce trends in Asia , subscribe to HRM Asia and be part of the region 's largest HR community !

While his status as one of the greatest comic book villains is undeniable , his appeal extends far beyond the pages of DC Comics , captivating audiences and infiltrating pop culture in ways that few fictional characters have achieved . He 's become an icon , a symbol of chaos and rebellion , with his image emblazoned on everything from t-shirts to tattoos . But why ? What is it about this agent of anarchy that resonates so deeply with audiences ? <p> Perhaps it 's the Joker 's embodiment of our darkest impulses , the forbidden desires and transgressive thoughts that lurk beneath the surface of civilised society . Characters like the Joker , Breaking Bad 's ( 2008-2013 ) Walter White , and Hannibal Lecter offer a vicarious thrill , allowing us to explore the shadows of human nature without consequence . The Joker 's enigmatic origins and ever-shifting persona further contribute to his mystique so with no definitive backstory or singular interpretation regarded as central to the character , he has become a blank canvas onto which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these very questions of identity , morality , and the nature of evil that director Todd Phillips attempts to grapple with in his latest film , Joker : Folie ? Deux , a follow-up to his critically acclaimed Joker ( 2019 ) . A controversial yet undeniably successful venture , Joker ignited a firestorm of debate surrounding its depiction of violence and its potential to inspire real-world harm . Despite the controversy , the film resonated with audiences , grossing over a billion dollars worldwide and earning Joaquin Phoenix ( Gladiator , Napoleon ) an Academy Award for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck , the troubled comedian turned psychotic killer . While Joker was conceived as a standalone film , its commercial success inevitably paved the way for a sequel , much to the chagrin of some who felt the story had reached its natural conclusion . After all , how much of a criminally insane serial killer can one celebrate ? <p> Advertisement ? <p> Joker : Folie ? Deux picks up where its predecessor left off , with Phoenix reprising his role as Arthur , now confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crimes . The depiction of Arthur 's grim existence in Arkham , punctuated by his interactions with cynical guards and the bleak routines of prison life , is captured in stark , unflinching detail . Phillips employs long , unbroken takes that pull viewers into the visceral reality of Arthur 's world , now more confined than ever . As his trial looms , his attorney , portrayed by Catherine Keener ( Being John Malkovich ) , devises a defence that separates ' Joker ' from ' Arthur ' -- a strategy that aims to leverage his fractured identity for sympathy . Yet , the introduction of Lady Gaga 's ( A Star Is Born , House of Gucci ) Harleen " Lee " Quinzel throws a wrench into this already precarious plan , adding a new complication to Arthur 's internal struggle . <p> The film takes an unexpected turn , embracing the jukebox musical genre as Arthur and Lee connect through song during therapy sessions .

While the initial connection between Arthur and Lee is forged through song , the film 's reliance on musical numbers quickly becomes its downfall . <p> A musical number , at its best , is supposed to elevate a story , allowing characters to express their inner emotions and connect with the audience on a deeper level . Think of the electrifying energy of 2001 's Moulin Rouge ! or the heartfelt sincerity of 2016 's La La Land -- jukebox musical films that understand the power of music to transform and transcend . <p> Sadly , this does n't seem to be the case for Joker : Folie ?

It 's a gamble that does n't quite pay off , leaving the film feeling more like a disjointed series of performances rather than a cohesive story . <p> This disjointedness is further evident in the film 's second act , where the narrative shifts from the confines of Arkham to a courtroom drama that unfortunately recycles familiar plot points without offering any fresh perspectives . Returning characters rehash past events , offering little in the way of new insight . Even the introduction of fan-favourite Gotham 's district attorney turned supervillain Harvey Dent ( Harry Lawtey , Industry ) , while offering a tantalising glimpse into Gotham 's future , ultimately serves as a missed opportunity for deeper thematic exploration on Arthur 's psyche . <p> Amidst these retellings , a potentially insightful subplot involving returning character Gary ( Leigh Gill , Game of Thrones ) teases a deeper exploration of the Joker 's complex character dynamics , hinting at how Arthur 's transformation into the Joker reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , this thread , like others , is abandoned too swiftly to resonate fully , leaving the audience with a frustrating sense of unfulfilled potential . Even the potential exploration of Arthur 's future with Lee and the possibility of a family is quickly dropped , suggesting potential narrative paths that are never fully realised . <p> The addition of Lady Gaga as Lee ( Harley Quinn ) , an eccentric character poised to harness Gaga 's formidable musical and acting prowess , similarly falls flat . Despite high expectations , Gaga 's portrayal of Harley never quite takes flight , lacking the depth and emotional range she demonstrated as singer Ally in A Star is Born , where she commanded the screen with raw emotion and vulnerability . Gaga 's Harley feels strangely subdued , a missed opportunity to showcase her undeniable star power . <p> Despite its tonal inconsistencies and narrative flaws , Joker : Folie ?

Deux wrestles with its disjointed and derivative identity . While the original Joker film presented a unified , though controversial , vision with strong visual and thematic motifs , Joker : Folie ? Deux struggles to find its footing . It ventures into new territory with more polished cinematography and complex character interactions , along with a potential musical romance that ultimately fails to resonate .

Notably , 22% of Thai consumers believe a cashless society will materialise between 2026 and 2028 . This is a considerable leap compared to just 16% of consumers across the region who share the same belief . <p> The Country Manager of the digital payments provider emphasised the crucial role of PromptPay , the national payment platform , in driving digital banking adoption , particularly during the post-COVID-19 era .

incentive schemes , Chee added . <p> Chee also pointed out that fares are collected for the entire public transport system , including buses and trains , to ensure that the public transport system remains financially sustainable . <p> " If our fares are not adjusted to reflect rising operating costs , the persistent shortfall would have a chronic impact on service quality and reliability over time . Or if we want to continue topping-up the shortfall via Government subsidies , it means that taxpayers will have to foot a higher bill . " <h> Costs of disruption <p> NCMP Leong Mun Wai and MPs Poh Li San , and Sharael Taha asked how the costs of the disruption will be covered . <p> Chee said that SMRT will bear the costs of providing the free bridging buses and regular bus services , the foregone fare revenue during the disruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the investigation outcome , he said . <p> This requirement applies to both rail operators should they encounter a disruption along their respective lines , he added . <p> As for MP Edward Chia 's question about compensation for workers , Chee said LTA and SMRT staff that worked overtime will be given overtime payment accordingly . <h> Stringent safety standards <p> Chee fielded questions by MPs on safety standards and maintenance regimes for trains . <p> Chee said : " LTA imposes stringent safety standards , aligned to international best practices , that operators must comply with . Operators who do not meet these standards will be subject to penalties , and where necessary , they will face additional regulatory conditions and monitoring . " <p> Chee added that to ensure that equipment and systems remain safe and reliable over time , LTA imposes Maintenance Performance Standards ( MPS ) under the operator 's license , which set out the requirements that the operator must fulfill in relation to maintenance . <p> There are also maintenance audits by independent external assessors to ensure operators ' compliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between failure increased steadily over the decade <p> Chee also highlighted that the Mean Kilometres Between Failure ( MKBF ) for the MRT network , which is a reliability benchmark used by cities globally , has steadily increased over the decade . <p> " Through the combined efforts of LTA and the operators , and supported by our unions and workers , we achieved our MKBF target of at least 1 million train-km in 2019 , and have maintained that since for all MRT lines , including the East-West Line . <p> This is comparable to the most reliable overseas metros , " Chee added . <p> While the MKBF figures up to end-Sept. 2024 have yet to be published , estimates show that all the MRT lines have achieved our target of at least 1 million train-km , Chee added . <p> For instance , the East-West Line was estimated to have an MKBF of 2.03 million train-km . <p> Chee also highlighted efforts made by LTA to improve reliability standards : <p> " Since 2011 , LTA has been working with rail operators to enhance their maintenance regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and invested in infrastructure such as signalling simulation centres to improve our operators ' ability to diagnose and remedy different faults . <p> The renewal of the six core systems of the North-South and East-West Lines is another major project which has improved our reliability standards . " <h> Public transport network more resilient today <p> Chee said that Singapore 's public transport network , today with its six MRT lines , and a sizeable fleet of buses , is more resilient and better able to cope with disruptions . <p> Referring to the recent EWL disruption , Chee said that the mitigation measures across the six days enabled most commuters to continue with their journeys , albeit with additional travelling time . <p> " The system was able to cope throughout the disruption , thanks to the strong efforts by our bus operators and staff on the ground supporting crowd and queue management , " he said . <p> Chee added : " Once the scale of the disruption on Sep . 25 was assessed , response plans from LTA and public transport operators were activated quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional staff . The safety of commuters was paramount , which was why we took the necessary time to complete the repairs and conduct rigorous testing before safely resuming service . " <p> LTA and TSIB will also conduct thorough investigations , Chee said . <p> " The investigation findings will be shared publicly . We will learn from this episode , remain vigilant , and work closely with our tripartite partners to continually improve our public transport system , " he added . <p> Chee also expressed his gratitude to public transport workers and community volunteers for their work in restoring full train services , providing bridging bus services to ferry commuters , and assisting commuters on the ground . <p> " We greatly appreciate your commitment and professionalism , and how many of you went beyond the call of duty and worked together as a cohesive team to overcome the challenges and help our commuters with their journeys , " he said . <p> He also thanked commuters and the public for their patience and understanding , and for showing care and concern to staff : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penned words of encouragement for our workers , and brought them food and drinks , which boosted their morale and lifted their spirits . <p> Your acts of kindness were very much appreciated by our workers and volunteers .

" We knew that whatever we led out with , there was going to be strong opinions across the spectrum of what people were expecting , what they wanted it to be .

In fact , one fan remade the trailer in animation , which was widely well-received by the community . <p> " I mean , that was one of the things fans were saying in response to the trailer : ' Why is it live action ? Why is n't it animated ? ' I think a lot of people were expecting that , and just the fact that there was live action and directly real-life characters and physical sets , did n't feel right with them , because in their imagination , they 've been playing it for a very long time , " Olafsson said . " And they 've kind of projected and seen a bunch of content obviously that 's been made both by us , the community , we 've made a story mode . We made animated content before , and there 's a lot of it out there . But that was also one of the reasons why the filmmakers wanted to go with live action rather than animate it , rather than do something that 's been done before . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very long time , " he continued . " A lot of the people who will see it were not born when the first contracts and the first discussions were had , and there was always going to be live action .

" These are , and everybody else on the project , are massive film pros , " he said . " And we felt that this is something we can do ... kind of try to explore this wish fulfillment or risk fantasy of what it is like to yourself , be in a physical , tangible , Minecraft universe , a Minecraft world .

In the past , the Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre director has said that he wanted to avoid an " Ugly Sonic " situation with Minecraft , referencing the widely derided original design for the Blue Blur in the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer , leading to a fan backlash and subsequent redesign . <p> Hess elaborated further in our interview , saying they 've been keeping up with the early feedback and trying to see how they can include some of what they 're seeing .

It 's like , Kevin just hit user inventory screen . <p> " It 's like , that 's gameplay and that 's amazing , but how do you get the visceral action of crafting something ? How do you make that a physical thing that a character can do ? " Hess said . " There were all of those kind of details that out of context seemed like total sacrilege , but actually in the context of the movie , work great and honors the game in a new way .

After all , it 's not like they 're adapting something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something with more of a fixed story . <p> That , Hess said , was something they intentionally decided to play with . <p> " That 's the beauty of the game , " he said , " For us , it just felt really fun to take a group of unlikely heroes , underdogs , and throw them into this world and put them on this crazy adventure , and ultimately having them kind of experience as you create in the game , but being able to craft your own destiny . And we just kind of took that concept and ran with it . " <p> And from the Mojang perspective , Olafsson pointed out a very unique struggle that Minecraft has : there is no one Minecraft experience that everyone points to as their most memorable Minecraft experience . Each person , he said , has their own interpretation based on what mods or resource packs they used , or what servers they played on . <h> " ( Steve 's ) like an empty page you write your story on . But that was also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to ground it very firmly in what we all refer to as ' vanilla Minecraft , ' like the unmodified Minecraft , " Olafsson said . " One of the characters of the movie , the young character , Henry , he enters the world , then is kind of a creator and maker in the real world . And his character then represents the maker or the modder or the builder coming into this world . And as a result , we 're going to see some really classic stuff , stuff that we want to see , some Beast Creepers , Endermen and that kind of stuff . And then we 're going to see some new stuff that Henry made . " <p> " I know people may go like , ' Wait , that 's not in the game , ' Olafsson continued . " But anybody who 's played Minecraft for a while has usually installed some sort of resource pack or mod , or changed it in some way for themselves . And that 's what this character is doing . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Minecraft , where they did n't have more established characters like Lara Croft or Mario .
