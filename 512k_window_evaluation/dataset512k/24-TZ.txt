They are also less likely than older women to get prenatal care , and more likely to experience stigma and discrimination in healthcare facilities if they do seek care . <p> All of the factors can complicate both pregnancy and childbirth . Maternal health complications are among the leading causes of death for adolescent girls worldwide . <p> The good news is that teenage pregnancies have declined in some parts of the world . However , they remain high in South Africa , especially in the country 's rural and low-income areas . <p> We are demographers specialising in public health dynamics in South Africa . We focus especially on maternal mortality , reproductive health , and the socio-economic determinants affecting population health . <p> In a recent study we sought to understand the factors that contribute to teenage pregnancies in South Africa . To do so we interviewed 20 young women . They were either pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenagers . We also analysed previous studies on the subject of teenage pregnancy . <p> Our findings make it clear that limited access to quality healthcare , socioeconomic challenges and a lack of awareness about pregnancy-related risks are all making teenage girls more vulnerable than older women to dying while pregnant , while giving birth or because of complications after they have given birth . <p> There 's a clear need for policies that improve healthcare access , reproductive health education , and support systems for young women . We hope the insights from our study will provide a foundation for reducing maternal mortality rates . This , in turn , can contribute to meeting broader health goals and addressing disparities in healthcare for young mothers in South Africa . <p> What the research found <p> A total of 20 young women aged between 15 and 24 who attended a health facility in Johannesburg were interviewed . They came from various backgrounds , including urban , suburban and rural areas . Most of them were single and unemployed , and had not studied further after completing their secondary education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternal mortality , the availability and accessibility of health services , and the participants ' knowledge about pregnancy . <p> The study also explored how social influences , such as family and community views , influenced their decisions about using contraceptives and considering abortion as an option . <p> Many shared stories about stigma and isolation . They also talked about the difficult choices they had to make because of social pressures and a lack of support . This included support from their partners . One said : " As soon as I told him who the baby 's father was ( which is him ) , he told me I should talk to the baby 's father because he is not . " <p> The young women often relied on their peers rather than their families for guidance , largely due to fear of disappointing or being reprimanded and punished by their parents . This fear is commonly expressed in research about teenage pregnancy . Unfortunately , their peers often have limited knowledge about sexual reproduction and health . <p> One participant explained that she 'd been taking contraceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective contraceptive use or awareness that contraceptives can not guarantee unintended pregnancies . <p> There is a strong correlation between educational attainment and reduced teenage pregnancy rates . Educational policies that keep girls in school have been shown to reduce their likelihood of becoming pregnant at a young age . Additionally , adolescents with higher levels of education are more likely to be aware of maternal health services and danger signs during pregnancy than their peers . This lowers their risk of complications . <p> For many of our participants , unplanned pregnancies placed them in the difficult position of choosing between continuing their education , or facing possible social exclusion . <p> Changing the situation <p> The findings shed light on the vulnerabilities of teenage mothers in South Africa . This group needs accessible healthcare that meets their unique needs as adolescents -- for instance , age-appropriate , non-judgmental counselling and guidance on prenatal and postnatal care . <p> They often require additional support in understanding contraceptive options to prevent repeat pregnancies , mental health support to address the psychological stress of early motherhood , and tailored educational resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complications like anaemia and preterm labour , which require targeted monitoring and intervention . Healthcare workers should be trained specifically to deal with these issues . <p> The research underscores the importance of educational policies that target teenage pregnancy prevention . By keeping young girls in school and providing them with comprehensive sexual education , the risk factors for early pregnancies can be significantly reduced . <p> But education need n't be limited to classrooms . Policies should also focus on increasing awareness of maternal health danger signs among adolescents . Public health campaigns that target teenagers , particularly in high-risk areas , could help young mothers understand the risks associated with pregnancy and encourage them to seek help early . <p> Improving maternal health outcomes for adolescent mothers will not only save lives : it will also improve women 's overall life expectancy . This has been the case in at least two countries : Rwanda and Sri Lanka . <p> In 2000 , Rwanda 's maternal mortality rate was 1,007 deaths per 100,000 live births . In 2020 it stood at 259 deaths per 100,000 live births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other global health bodies regard a maternal mortality rate of 70 deaths or fewer per 100,000 live births as the target for countries to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 , which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages . <p> However , it is a vast improvement from the 2000 figure . Rwanda has achieved this by , among other things , focusing on accessible maternal healthcare services , training community health workers , and providing financial support for maternal services . <p> Crucially , special programmes are in place to meet young mothers ' unique needs , such as confidential reproductive health counselling , reducing stigma , and encouraging teenage mothers to use healthcare facilities .

At the same time , it is important that all Tanzanian consumers have the will and ability to judge the quality of products . <p> In Japan , there is a proverb that says , ' buying cheap goods is waste of money/You get what you pay for " . <p> I would like people to think that buying a reliable product made by a reliable manufacturer , even if it is a little more expensive , because that is more profitable in the medium to long term than buying a cheap product that breaks easily . <p> Until such thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the proliferation of counterfeit and other such products , and I think it will also hinder the development of Tanzania 's manufacturing industry . <p> If the government of Tanzania is willing to work on reforming the countermeasures against fake products and raising people 's awareness in this regard , Japan is ready to cooperate in any way possible . <p> As a diplomat , how do you assess the performance of President Samia Suluhu Hassan ' s government . <p> As a diplomat , I would like to refrain making any light-hearted comment about the leader of the country in which I am assigned . <p> However , I personally respect and applaud the strong leadership of H.E .

Already , by the mid-1980s , Dar es Salaam was presenting huge governance challenges so much so that in June 1996 , the Dar es Salaam City Council was disbanded and was replaced by a City Commission . The Commission did a great job of cleaning up the city and improving infrastructure .

The unitary structure was seen as being inadequate to handle city matters , as it had grown considerably large .

Ilala got the city centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high value area of Oysterbay ; and Temeke got the port , the airport and the industrial area . <p> In 2014 , two other municipalities , Kigamboni and Ubungo were created , out of the Temeke and Kinondoni municipalities respectively . <p> A Dar es Salaam City Council ( DCC ) was also established , with separate responsibilities from the municipalities , as an overarching authority to mainly coordinate issues and attend to issues cutting across the municipalities ; and matters of inter-dependency such as inter-district road networks and joint activities such as transport , environment , tourism , employment and the like . Soon , however , clashes developed between the five municipalities and the overarching DCC , which had no physical territory . Clashes also included misunderstandings over sources of revenue .
