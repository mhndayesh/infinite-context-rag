Under this model , users are offered an ad-free experience for a monthly fee , ensuring their data is n't utilized for targeted advertising . Conversely , users who opt not to pay are subjected to personalized advertisements on their social media feeds . <p> In a preliminary assessment released Monday , the European Commission asserted that Meta 's approach fails to meet the requirements outlined in the Digital Markets Act ( DMA ) , which aims to regulate giant tech companies .

Furthermore , Meta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal data while maintaining functionality similar to the ad-supported versions of Facebook and Instagram . <p> " In the commission 's preliminary view , this binary choice compels users to agree to the amalgamation of their data and does not provide them with a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta 's social networks , " the commission stated . <p> To comply with the DMA , the commission stipulated that Meta must introduce " equivalent " versions of Facebook and Instagram that minimize the use of personal data . <p> A spokesperson for Meta defended the new model , asserting its alignment with the DMA and other regulatory mandates . <p> " Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a widely accepted business model across various industries , and we developed the ad-free subscription option to address multiple regulatory obligations , including the DMA .

Given the sheer amount of money they stood to lose ( reckoned in billions of dollars ) , it came as no surprise when Eni-Vitol decided to take their case internationally . <p> We have discussed the issues at length elsewhere <p> In a previous essay on this site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant detail . In another essay I laid out the basis of my argument that GNPC 's technical testimony in this instance was procured by political pressure as it simply did n't hold water . <p> As the reader would no doubt notice from these essays , civil society organisations ( CSOs ) in Ghana engaged in the petroleum sector , especially IMANI and ACEP , have exhaustively examined the matters in the controversy and , with deep patriotic concern , warned the government that its actions in the attempted forced " unitisation " of the two offshore petroleum sites are completely against the national interest . In this short essay , we shall show why the tribunal 's final decision given this week , and the consequences of the unjustified " forced unitisation " directives , are all highly embarrassing for Ghana and completely detrimental to the country 's reputation and economic position . <p> The case against the government of Ghana <p> When Eni-Vitol filed its arbitration notice , the government of Ghana initially did n't even bother to submit a detailed response . <p> Eni-Vitol nonetheless proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of their case is the simple fact that Ghana is trying to force them to merge a highly valuable , and proven , oil field with another one that has not yet been properly assessed , to international standards , in order to determine if there is even any oil in place . <p> In the circumstances , such an attempt amounts to a pure ruse to seize a large part of a highly lucrative asset and hand it over to another business without any sensible foundation . International law frowns on unjust expropriation of foreign-owned assets under different guises . <p> If the government was genuinely interested in merging the fields purely because it wishes to improve efficiency , it would first focus on ensuring that the other business owning the " greenfield " block undertakes the proper technical investigations to confirm if indeed there is oil on that block , and what quantity exactly .

The only beneficiary would have been the owner of the block next door , the optimistically named " Afina field " . The question that has never been properly addressed is why the government of Ghana was willing to go to such lengths to benefit the Afina owners , even to the detriment of its own economic position and international reputation . <p> In light of its position on the matter , what specifically did Eni-Vitol want the international tribunal to do for them ?

Simple ! <p> The government 's attempt at defending its actions <p> What was the government 's principal defense at the tribunal and how does it square with how the Attorney General is attempting to spin the outcomes of the proceedings ? <p> The government 's super-expensive international lawyers summed up its case in the paragraph below found in the opening of its statement of defense . ( " Claimants " in the text extract refers to Eni-Vitol . ) <p> Government of Ghana 's primary aim in paying for these expensive lawyers to fight its baseless cause at arbitration was to get the tribunal to agree with its approach to the forced unitisation . <p> The government knew that its case was not in the national interest <p> The Ghanaian government did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-detrimental approach to the merger , which would have damaged the interests of its own citizens , they also wanted the tribunal to find the investors guilty of breaching their agreement with Ghana by not lying down and rolling over immediately they were asked to hand over a juicy chunk of their asset to another business . <p> The true mindset of the government 's agents in this matter , especially the Attorney General who instructed these lawyers , is exposed by paragraph 49 of the government 's statement of defense . <p> What that paragraph simply says is that in the end even if the merger leads to losses , Ghana is the ultimate bearer of those losses and so why is Eni-Vitol sweating ? Such a deeply unpatriotic and reckless argument to make ! <p> The government , egged on by the Attorney General , believes that it can proceed with technically reckless actions in Ghana 's petroleum sector , actions that will impose losses on the citizens of the country , with no consequence at all . What it is essentially saying here to investors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bereaved ? We are willing to bear the losses . " <p> In fact , the government spends the overwhelming proportion of its defense arguing against " commerciality " as an important logic in any regulatory directive that affects the economic structure of a petroleum transaction in which Ghana is involved . It attempts , in breathtaking elaborateness , to make the case that even if the Afina block does not have any oil , it is fine to merge it with the oil producing Sankofa -- Gye Nyame field ( the one in which Eni-Vitol have majority interest ) even though the inevitable result will be the dilution of economic returns for both Ghana and Eni-Vitol , and even if the only one who stands to benefit is the third-party private business next door . <p> The disorganised logic of the government 's case <p> Perhaps , in a belated recognition that their longwinded arguments making the case that commercial logic is irrelevant and all that matters is the discretion of government ministers , the government 's expensive lawyers began to moderate their tone somewhat when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merged field to the private owner of the next-door Afina block . <p> What they are saying here , in essence , is that the precise allocation of acreage in the combined block is still in the works . The illogicality of that argument is inherent in fact that any such decision has to be based on knowledge of how much oil is in the separate blocks . Without knowing how much oil each party is in essence " bringing to the combined table " , there is no technically sound way to divvy up the combined block . Since determining " commerciality " is how you confirm that the owner of the non-producing oil block is bringing anything to the table at all , the hollowness of this belated concession about the exact split of the combined field becomes crystal clear , laid side by side with the claim that commerciality is an irrelevant factor . <p> After all this turning and twisting , how did the government want the tribunal to rule ? Ghana 's counter-claims offer a good view . <p> Ghana wanted the tribunal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it wanted to be paid by the investors for the pleasure of being robbed of their petroleum assets . <p> After these brazen demands , the government proceeded to list its requested reliefs . <p> The government failed to secure any of its principal reliefs <p> The judges at the tribunal must have had a good laugh . But deep down they were not amused . The government 's punitive claims against Eni-Vitol were totally dismissed . By even the twisted accounts of the Attorney General , it is clear that the tribunal did not so much look at them twice . <p> Whilst the Attorney General is celebrating the decision of the tribunal not to award large damages against Ghana , and its instructions for Ghana to only pay half of the arbitration costs , the truth is that the government 's attempt to get the tribunal to sympathise with its positions was wholly unsuccessful . Eni-Vitol on the other hand got what they mostly set out to achieve : a ruling by an international tribunal that the government 's conduct is unlawful , on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own laws . <p> The tribunal ruled in Ghana 's interest <p> In the end , though , especially for us in civil society , what matters is that the citizens understand clearly that the international tribunal was on their side and their government was acting in ways that would have considerably damaged their interests . <p> Ghana had to issue sovereign guarantees and tap the World Bank 's guarantee facility in order to get the Eni-Vitol field operational . <p> The Eni-Vitol field is now the major supplier of gas for the country 's power plants . Ghana obtains significant revenues from its equity stake in the field . Forcing this lucrative project into a poorly thought through merger with an unproven , greenfield , block would have caused massive disruption , undermined the commercial viability of the whole enterprise , and therefore ultimately eroded the benefits of the producing and proven asset to the people of Ghana . It is very likely that the Eni-Vitol would have stopped gas production and plunged Ghana into dumsor should the situation had persisted down the path it was on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions <p> Already , the needless controversy over the forced unitisation has cost Ghana dearly . The development of major oil discoveries such as Eban and Akoma have stalled . There is evidence that some major international oil companies have been looking askance at the country since the government began this ill-fated expropriation agenda . Ghana has n't brought a new oil field onstream for years ( Jubilee South-East does n't really count as it is merely the extension of an existing field ) . Oil output and state revenues from petroleum have been declining steadily and steeply . <p> Someone must be held accountable <p> The Attorney General 's conduct in failing to properly advise the country , in promoting a baseless position in an international forum , in opting to engage hyper-expensive lawyers costing this country millions of dollars , and in the end failing to secure any of the principal reliefs sought by Ghana is atrociously bad on its own .

In addition to the strong and inexplicable urge to divert public and paid-up investor stakes in Sankofa -- Gye Nyame to a private business ? <p> What a shame ! <p> DISCLAIMER : The Views , Comments , Opinions , Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited .

These moves underscore the government 's commitment to boosting farmers ' livelihoods and enhancing educational opportunities for the children of cocoa farmers . <p> The first announcement was a raise in the producer price of cocoa . Based on the recommendations of the Producer Price Review Committee , the price per tonne has been adjusted from GH ? 48,000 to GH ? 49,600 , translating to an increase from GH ? 3,000 to GH ? 3,100 per bag .

With this latest increase , the President aims to provide cocoa farmers with a more secure income and an added incentive to continue cultivating Ghana 's most valuable cash crop . <p> The President also highlighted that the adjustment is part of the government 's broader strategy to enhance the welfare of cocoa farmers , who contribute significantly to Ghana 's agricultural economy . The increase in the producer price is not just a temporary measure , but part of a series of policies aimed at ensuring that farmers receive their fair share of revenue from cocoa exports .

" <p> The Cocoa Management System ( CMS ) , a digital platform introduced by COCOBOD , will be instrumental in implementing this expanded scholarship program . The CMS was designed to register all cocoa farmers and maintain a comprehensive database to improve transparency and traceability in Ghana 's cocoa industry .

Now , with this support , we can send our children to get a higher education without worrying about the fees . " <p> With these new initiatives , the government aims to further strengthen the cocoa sector , providing not only immediate financial relief through price increases but also long-term support by empowering the next generation of farmers and leaders through education . The expanded scholarship scheme is expected to drive greater educational attainment among the children of cocoa farmers , enabling them to acquire skills and knowledge that can benefit their communities and contribute to the national economy . <p> In closing , President Akufo-Addo reaffirmed his administration 's dedication to supporting Ghana 's cocoa farmers and ensuring their welfare remains a top priority .

So , as the nation waits in suspense , take this precious time to quietly funnel a little " gratitude " to your campaign backers . <p> Know , however , that after some time , you need to explain why you have n't started any real reforms yet . Do n't worry . Blame " internal adjustments " . Tell everyone you 're carefully evaluating the mess the previous government left behind . " If you come from that government , do n't mention you were part of it . <p> Make some visible , superficial changes . Issue memos about " transparency " and " accountability " and post them where everyone can see them . Remember , perception is everything . Pretend you 're nothing like your predecessor . <p> If you 've done it right , by the end of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off your campaign friends , and convinced half the country that you 're still the change they 've been waiting for . <p> Second Year : Blame , Reframe , and Claim the Funds <p> You 're now settled in . The public has had time to digest your promises , and your cabinet is in place . It 's time to play the second-year card : blame everything on the previous government . Go public with news about hidden debts . Make it sound like you 've just discovered these problems . <p> When citizens start pointing fingers , remind them that your grand vision takes time . By now , it 's perfectly acceptable to show up on TV looking exhausted , as if you 're carrying the nation on your shoulders . It 's also your time to chop . But chop wisely . <p> At the same time , invest in projects that can serve as double agents . These initiatives look good on paper and make you appear productive while doubling as ways to channel funds to allies . Infrastructure is ideal : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " long-term " projects are best because they require substantial budgets -- and even more substantial delays . <p> People will start reminding you of your campaign promises around this time . Do n't panic . This is where you subtly let them know that reality differs from those campaign promises . But do n't say it outright ; that 's too blunt . Instead , mention that " external pressures " or " global challenges " are affecting your ability to make rapid progress . <p> The second year is about solidifying your position , securing resources for your circle , and subtly managing the public 's expectations . If you do it well , no one will notice that you 're not exactly moving mountains . And by the end of this year , you 'll have a reputation for resilience and resourcefulness -- and a chunk of the budget to keep things comfortable for the next few years . <p> Third Year : Progress and Projects -- But No Promises <p> Now we 're in the third year -- the " action year . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're technically halfway through your term . People are realising you have n't done much beyond holding press conferences . It 's time to roll out some impressive-sounding initiatives that make you look productive without committing to anything concrete . <p> Launch a series of " transformational " projects . Pick a sector that 's perpetually underfunded or famously difficult to measure , like healthcare , education , or infrastructure . Then , unveil plans to " revolutionise " it . The trick is to keep everything broad and ambiguous . For example , announce a " 10-year education overhaul " or a " nationwide healthcare expansion . " Of course , these projects will never reach fruition . But they make for stunning headlines . <p> It 's also time to break ground for new roads , hospitals , or schools . But remember , you do n't want actual progress to be made here . Here , you want ribbons to cut , photos to take , and press releases to send out . Emphasise that these are " just the beginning " of much bigger projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like a shiny shovel in the dirt . <p> Do n't make plans , but reference " plans " constantly . The beauty of the third year is pretending to have a comprehensive plan without creating one . Announce that you 're working on a " national action framework , " but do n't publish it . If people ask why they ca n't see it , tell them it 's under careful scrutiny because you " do n't want to make the same mistakes as the past government . " <p> Avoid clear timelines or measurable objectives . These are traps that could later be used against you . Aim for nebulous goals like " enhancing public well-being " or " promoting inclusive growth . " If people press for specifics , mention that you 're " consulting with stakeholders . " This gives the impression of serious deliberation while leaving everything open-ended . <p> In this year , you want tolook very busy . Schedule frequent meetings , preferably with foreign diplomats or international organisations . Foreign visitors make excellent props because they ca n't hold you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen shaking hands with ambassadors or visiting dignitaries . <p> But keep sight of your goal . You are laying the groundwork for re-election . A few strategically timed leaks to the press about your " dedication to unfinished projects " can help . Begin seeding the narrative that " real change takes time " and that you 're only just beginning to see the fruits of your labour . This will be crucial in your fourth year when you embark on another campaign for votes to continue ( not ) governing . <p> Fourth Year : Campaign Mode Activated -- Forget Governance ! <p> This is the grand finale of your term . This year is not about governing -- those days are long behind you . It 's time to pivot , full-throttle , into campaign mode . Your job now is to convince the people that you 've been doing such an incredible job that it would be a crime to replace you . <p> Remember all those half-complete projects from the third year ? Now 's the time to parade them around to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " visits to these projects . Get some media coverage showing you in a hard hat or laying bricks . <p> Slip in phrases like " Just a little more time , and this will transform the country . " Make it sound like these half-finished buildings are monuments to your hard work instead of monuments to your government 's inaction . <p> You must present yourself as a " leader in progress " . Write speeches that focus on continuity , stability , and the dangers of switching leadership mid-stride . The goal here is to make people fear change . Make it sound like electing someone else would undo all your " hard work " . <p> Make the media your best friend . If you 've been smart , you 've kept a few key journalists on your side over the past years . Now 's the time to cash in those favours . Arrange for a few glowing editorials and a TV interview where you 're portrayed as a tireless , selfless leader . <p> In these interviews , let the whole world know you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal comfort to lead . It does n't matter that you 've actually been living quite comfortably . What matters is the image . <p> Attack the opposition . But do n't overdo it . You do n't need a full smear campaign . Just enough to make the public uneasy . Drop subtle suggestions that your opponents are inexperienced . Only you can " guide the nation through troubled waters " . <p> Meanwhile , try to appear calm , mature , and above petty politics . Let your party members do the dirty work . This way , you come across as dignified . <p> A few months to election day is the home stretch , so do n't hold back . Promise the moon and stars , knowing you 'll never have to deliver them . Make sure these promises are dramatic enough to stick in people 's minds . Of course , your critics will call them unrealistic , but your supporters will latch on to the hope . In the end , that 's what you need . <p> The fourth year is about putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you want people to feel that choosing you is a duty to preserve " the future . " And it is a sin not to . And if you win , start the whole cycle over again . If you lose , watch from afar as the new leader inevitably follows the same script .

@@117988231 <p> Modern vehicles are packed with safety features , but few are as impactful as traction control systems . Mandated in passenger vehicles worldwide since 2014 , these systems have been credited with saving countless lives by keeping drivers in control during slippery or dangerous conditions . <p> But here 's a puzzler : if it 's such a game-changer , why is there a button to turn it off ? <p> Let 's get into what makes traction control so crucial -- and why sometimes , just sometimes , you might need to deactivate it . <p> What Is Traction Control ? <p> Traction control , often referred to as anti-skid systems , is an enhancement of the Anti-lock Braking System ( ABS ) . Its primary job is to prevent wheel spin and maintain vehicle stability during acceleration . <p> Over the years , these systems have become increasingly sophisticated , adopting names like ESC ( Electronic Stability Control ) , VSC ( Vehicle Stability Control ) , DSC ( Dynamic Stability Control ) , and Stabilitrak , depending on the manufacturer . <p> At its core , traction control works by collecting data from multiple sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can control braking , throttle ( accelerator ) , steering , transmission and even suspension ( on some advanced models ) to prevent over steer , understeer , hydroplaning , skidding , or sliding . Essentially , it helps keep the car planted and pointed in the right direction , even in challenging conditions . <p> The Evolution of a Life-Saving Feature <p> Traction control has advanced to such an extent that some argue it has made drivers overconfident . To counter this , modern systems alert the driver whenever they activate , typically with a blinking warning light , a chime , or both . <p> Traction control will be shown with a symbol similar to any of these . <p> But here 's an important note : traction control does n't make driving foolproof . It can only work within the physical limits of the vehicle .

Traction control can intervene too early , limiting the car 's potential and making it harder to find its limits . <p> Deep Mud , Sleet , Snow or Ice : In extreme weather conditions , a bit of wheel spin can be helpful to get moving . Traction control might cut power too aggressively , leaving you stuck . <p> Mechanical Issues : If there 's a problem with the system 's sensors or components , it may behave unpredictably . Many modern vehicles will alert you to such issues and disable the system , urging you to drive cautiously . <p> High-Horsepower Vehicles : Cars with immense power might overwhelm the traction control system , especially during sudden acceleration .

@@117988236 <p> Politics in Ghana , like much of Africa , is often dubbed a " dirty game " -- filled with mudslinging , grandiose promises , and a singular focus on winning at all costs , often sidelining meaningful policy discussions . <p> Nowhere is this more evident than in the creative arts sector , which has become a prized battleground for political parties eager to win over celebrities , artistes , and their fans with bold promises of reform . <p> As the election cycle heats up , the two major contenders -- the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) and the National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) -- are once again turning their attention to the entertainment industry , each presenting their vision as the key to unlocking the sector 's potential . <p> But amid the soundbites and showmanship , a few crucial questions arise : Are these proposals truly in the best interest of Ghana 's creative community , or are they just another round of political theater ? And does this combative discourse help or hinder the sector 's growth ? <p> The NPP 's Streaming Platform Gambit <p> As the incumbent party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a streaming app , positioning it as a game-changer for Ghanaian music . The grand promises ? Prioritize local content , amplify the reach of Ghanaian artists , and improve revenue retention within the music industry . <p> On paper , it 's a move that aligns with global trends . Music streaming is , after all , the undisputed leader in global music consumption , with platforms like Spotify , Apple Music , and other regional players reshaping how artists monetize their work and engage with fans . <p> The NDC 's Counter-Proposal : Pay-Per-View Television <p> Not to be outdone , the opposition NDC has thrown its own hat into the ring , proposing a pay-per-view television channel . Party communicator Abeiku Santana is at the forefront , arguing that this platform would allow viewers to pay directly for content , with a focus on live events and shows that showcase Ghanaian entertainers . The NDC claims that this model would provide more direct compensation for artists while offering new avenues for monetizing live performances . <p> Clash of the Titans , or Political Theatre ? <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they 've been framed and discussed publicly leaves much to be desired . Santana 's dismissal of the NPP 's streaming platform as a " lie " that wo n't benefit the industry is a classic example of the knee-jerk partisanship that often plagues Ghanaian politics . <p> This raises an important question : Must one party trash the other 's proposal in order to promote its own ? This kind of adversarial rhetoric does little to foster the kind of nuanced , fact-driven discussions that the creative sector so desperately needs . <p> Evaluating the Proposals : A More Balanced View <p> To understand the real potential of these proposals , it 's important to look at the numbers driving the global industry . In 2023 , global music streaming revenues hit a record-breaking $19.3 billion , more than seven times the $2.6 billion generated in 2015 . Music streaming now makes up over 67% of total global recorded music revenue . <p> Meanwhile , the video streaming market generated a staggering $199 billion in 2023 . Valued at $555.89 billion that year , the market is projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach $2.66 trillion by 2032 . Together , music and video streaming brought in a combined total of $218.3 billion in 2023 -- a figure roughly three times the GDP of Ghana in the same year . Meanwhile , pay-per-view services are expected to generate $1.22 billion in 2024 , growing at a rate of 16% . <p> But here 's where things get tricky : the proposals from both the NPP and NDC only touch on small fragments of this global streaming revolution . The NPP 's focus on music streaming is commendable but narrow , while the NDC 's pay-per-view model , though interesting , taps into an even smaller slice of the pie . <p> The Big Oversight : The Film Industry <p> At first glance , the NPP 's proposal might seem to have the upper hand , but a closer look reveals a glaring oversight : the film industry is entirely absent . While music is a significant cultural export , the film sector faces even more acute challenges -- ranging from resource constraints and distribution bottlenecks to difficulties with monetization . A comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unique needs of filmmakers , actors , and the wider ecosystem that supports visual storytelling . <p> Empty Promises or Real Solutions ? <p> Both parties seem more interested in outdoing one another than in understanding the global dynamics shaping the creative industries . The current state of affairs might lead one to believe that these politicians are either woefully uninformed or offering hollow promises to appease voters . <p> What 's missing in both proposals is any reference to the frameworks that would guide the implementation of their grand ideas . Neither the NPP nor the NDC has provided a coherent strategy for addressing the deeper , systemic challenges facing the creative sector as a whole . <p> Time for Serious Solutions <p> The creative arts sector in Ghana holds immense potential -- not just as a source of cultural pride , but as an economic driver and a means of soft power on the global stage . However , realizing this potential requires more than flashy campaign promises and partisan bickering . <p> As the election approaches , it 's time for politicians to retire the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantive dialogue about the future of Ghana 's creative industries . The country 's artists , audiences , and cultural heritage deserve nothing less than a clear , precise , and actionable plan to elevate the sector and , by extension , the nation as a whole . <p> The theatre of Ghanaian politics may be in disrepair , but the stage is set for real change . It 's up to political leaders to rise to the occasion and deliver performances worthy of the talent and potential that exists within the country 's vibrant creative community . <p> We need " Change " and I dare say " It is Possible " to reach the heights we dream . Sincerely , these two parties offer next to nothing to even begin to compare , instead of being partisan , let us push them as an industry to engage , indulge , discuss , discard , refine and relook at their bogus policies and promises till we get one befitting the vibrant industry we have . <p> About the author <p> With over 25 years of experience in the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , music , and entrepreneurship .
